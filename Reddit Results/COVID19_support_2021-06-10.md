How long will social distancing be? I am watching movies of the old normal and it's saddening me. I hope it isn't too much longer. Wearing a mask, keeping 6ft apart, no parties, etc.
## Comment #22


I am seeking advice on the following question.

Today I visited the post office.  I was masked up, had an n-95 and a face covering over the n-95 and I was wearing sunglasses.  I noticed this guy in front of me had a surgical mask but the nose was exposed.   Maybe it was me but I thought he didn’t look to good.  The female behind the counter scolded him and he put the mask over his nose.  My question is, if the guy was sick with Covid, what is my risk of catching it from him. I stayed my distance and did not use the kiosk he used.  I’m just worried because I read about aerosols and was wondering how much aerosols come from the nose.

# Is the new delta variant something to be concerned about?


Created: 2021-06-10 11:43:14

Been seeing a lot of scary articles about the covid variant from India. Some were saying this could bring more shutdowns, it's resistant to the vaccine, and it's extremely infectious. Is any of this true? I already have both doses of the Pfizer vaccine and I'm just super confused.

https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/nwliq2/is_the_new_delta_variant_something_to_be/
## Comment #1


What I've read is that yes, it is more infectious than the "wild type" covid strain, and the outcomes are more severe . That being said, full vaccination seems to have an 88% efficacy rate against the delta strain, so that's good news. Bad news is that one dose is only about 33% effective, so countries with low double dose vaccination rates are vulnerable to a huge surge.
## Comment #2


Yes it is a concern.  It’s apparently more transmittable and more deadly. Just look at India.  The good news is fully vaccinated with Pfizer and even moderna to a lesser degree appear to be sufficiently protected. The best thing anyone can do to stop the spread and stop the variants is to get vaccinated

# Dental assistant touched the door and then touched my mouth


Created: 2021-06-10 15:13:26

Posted awhile back about needing to go to the dentist. I did, and it was a huge mistake. First, she pointed her finger in my face and yelled at me for not waiting 2 weeks after my second dose (just got it on Monday). Except, this was the only appointment they had until December. Then, I asked her if she had pressed a button using the same glove, and she yelled at me about how careful she always was. Then, she closes the door with her pinky finger, and *used that pinky finger to pull my lip down.*

They say fomite transmission is rare but if something is put directly in your mouth that's surely a different story. I technically have 2 doses, although protection from the second one hasn't kicked in... one dose is about 80% effective, right? I really hope I'll be okay. I don't know if I should self-isolate for the next 2 weeks or not.

# My gran has covid and i am worried aick


Created: 2021-06-10 00:30:15

I found out today that my gran has covid. She caught it over the weekend and she said Sunday was the worst  day as she was sore and achy. When i spoke to her today she sounded ok just a bit bunged up like she has the cold. She also has had both her vaccines and doesn't have any under lying conditions. But it still won't stop me worrying

https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/nwakgr/my_gran_has_covid_and_i_am_worried_aick/
## Comment #1


I’m sorry to hear that, and so glad she is double vaxxed! The good news is those things really work. With  any luck she’s over the worst of it. When will you feel like she’s out of the woods?
## Comment #2


Fully vaccinated people are protected from anything other than mild symptoms - when AZ followed fully vaccinated people to check efficacy there were no deaths in the trial group. For what it's worth, a whole corridor of people at an old people's home where a friend of mine's parents live tested positive after they had all been vaccinated and they were all asymptomatic - no-one would have known if they hadn't been tested.

This is no different to the way other vaccines work - the disease still circulates but if you're vaccinated the worst you're likely to get is a mild dose. Hope she's feeling better soon.
# I think reintegrating back into society will be hard, to say the least.


Created: 2021-06-09 05:55:02

<mark>For the past year and three months, since COVID started, I've been in solitary confinement. I graduated high school June 2020, withdrew from community college Fall 2020, and failed Spring 2020 because I've been so zapped of motivation or a will to continue. I had a retail job as a cashier in mid-2020 for a few months, but I resigned after being unable to cope with intrusive thoughts (unrelated to COVID, related to my poor mental state). Since then, I've been holed up in my bedroom, spending most of my days in bed. I've tried exercising occasionally, but whenever I start a routine, my anxiety worsens (contrary to common wisdom).

I've never been a very social person. I've always had mental health problems lurking around the corner, sometimes taking the center stage. They've prevented me from enjoying myself or having fun, or seeking friendships. I still don't really understand the nature of my mental health, other than being fundamentally broken at its core. And it seems the pandemic has exposed a lot of this brokenness, and it feels like I'll never recover. Even going to the bank, or walking up to the cashier, conjures awkwardness. It's like I have trouble even communicating like a normal human being anymore.

And I haven't really spoken to anyone outside my family or the internet. I've become so antisocial, I'm afraid people will look at me with derision. I've pretty much regressed to the mental state of a child. I feel like I'm 12 again, except in a 19 year old's body. At times it's like my mind even forgets the present, like it was some weird dream, and I'm back to caring about the stuff I did when I was 12, and having the thoughts I had back then too. It's very weird.

I don't really know what to do. I feel so adrift, with no real future. I used to be a better writer, more responsible, and more capable of interacting normally with other humans, but now I feel like these skills have frayed. I'm in the midst of a rut with no way out. And the worst part are the weird physical problems I've been starting to have, from migraines (when I never did before), to dissociative spells, to random bouts of dread. Honestly I kind of want to stay in bed forever, but I know that's not possible. Yet retail was too much *a year ago*, let alone now when I've deteriorated even more. I don't know what to do. </mark>

https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/nvojxt/i_think_reintegrating_back_into_society_will_be/
## Comment #1


I feel like I wrote this, except I'm 31. Dealt with depression, anxiety, and self-loathing since I could form thoughts. Always had a bit of agoraphobia. My will to live life is depleted. Completely. Exhaustion isn't a strong enough word. I'm fully vaccinated but I don't want to do anything, see anyone, or go anywhere. I was barely functioning before covid. Since then I lost my job and there are people I no longer want in my life due to differing views where my line in the sand is drawn. It's simple to say those words but I'm completely and utterly heartbroken. The world itself is broken and seems to get worse everyday. I'm beyond grateful for all the good in my life; there's a lot. But it doesn't stop me from feeling like this. I've felt like this my whole life, and life feels more and more like an insufferable prison sentence every day. I don't know what to do, I don't know what the future will hold, and it terrifies me to think about it.

I'm sorry. I wish I had advice to offer. You're not alone in how you feel. I'm so sorry you feel this way too.
## Comment #2


This sounds very severe.  It sounds like you need mental health treatment,medication,  possibly a day program for severe anxiety. Have you reached out to a healthcare provider yet?
## Comment #3


Seek professional help from a therapist, this isn't just your average COVID blues. They can help you improve your mental health. Good luck and a virtual hug!
## Comment #4


I definitely relate to the loss of social skills bit. I get so nervous to talk to people. I mean I was never great at it, but without practice I really struggle.
## Comment #5


Congrats, you've got severe depression. I've been there, isolated myself, and it was horrendous, but the good news is that you will be able to lift yourself out of it quicker than you think, even though your brain is telling you it's going to feel like this forever. It's not, I promise. I've been through it. With help, maybe medication, and letting yourself reenter the world, you'll find you spring back. Honestly, I know you probably won't believe me, because everything in your head will be telling you this is it for you, but if you want to feel better, you will get there.
## Comment #6


The truth is, everyone’s social skills are frayed and awkward. Lots of people are traumatized. That’s ok. I’d bet good money that your depression goggles are showing you a worse reality than actually exists. I have been there with mental health issues and I’ve been medicated, which can help a lot. All of the problems you’ve mentioned can be dealt with by practice, but depression makes it hard to work up the focus and motivation. That’s okay. What if you try to do one thing every day that’s good for you and you didn’t do yesterday? It can be small, like working out or scheduling time with a friend. Practice self care in whatever capacity works for you.
## Comment #7


You are definitely not alone. I feel barely human and I can’t bear the thought of looking for another job. You don’t sound 12, and you don’t sound awkward, but from experience I know that writing something is very different from coming up with the right words in person.

I know you said retail was too much (my job was also becoming too much even before the pandemic) but is there anything else you could do work wise? Anything that you could imagine yourself doing that won’t feel like too much? I know *every* job probably seems so far out of reach right now mentally (I’m there with you) but is there anything at all that you could see yourself doing? Personally I know the answer for me is some sort of regular social interaction. I’ve always felt a strong correlation between having a job where I talk to people every day and my confidence increasing. Except that In between it’s hard to get back on the wagon—the less I do the less I want to do. I have my husband pushing me towards it, but if I lived alone I guarantee I wouldn’t be getting out of bed for this crap. Most days the tiniest setback will have me thinking *I can’t believe I got out of bed for this*.

What is it that you didn’t like about retail?
## Comment #8


Getting vaccinated helps. After I got the vaccine, I felt a lot more comfortable going out. Even going on walks outside and getting fresh air helps.
## Comment #9


I feel you! I just want to hang out with my friends, go for shopping freely etc. but I don't want to go to the office for the work. Wish companies/schools could offer the chance for those who want to work or study home office permanently. I hate waking up so early everyday, taking the public transportation for hours and then arriving at the work as already very exhausted, it drains me a lot.

# Feeling bad because of hypothetical situation - Toddler


Created: 2021-06-09 22:56:51

I have a 14-month toddler, and she’s the only one that isn’t vaccinated in our family circle! (Yay!!) We live in Austin, TX, where we are lucky to have a population that is 50% fully vaccinated.

Before this past month, I was on high-alert about everything! I was worried about curbside groceries, delivery meals, and doctor’s appointments. I only recently stopped wiping groceries in December, and stopped secretly quarantining some groceries 3 weeks ago.

EDMR Therapy was a MAJOR help! I highly recommend it! I’m so much more realistic in what should be done, and I feel I can trust guidance now!

Today, her grandmother asked what kind of stuff we can do with her! I feel like I hypothetically put my baby in danger by accidentally saying that her vaccinated grandmother could take her to Hobby Lobby. I recalled my comment immediately and clarified, but I feel so...stupid.

I slipped up and I feel terrible about it. I feel like the repercussions could have been devastating.

It was so easy to mess up. I feel so terrible after spending a full year being intensely strict to keep everyone safe to just almost send my baby out into an indoor store!

Did I mess up bad? Am I letting this hypothetical get out of hand?

https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/nw8qnb/feeling_bad_because_of_hypothetical_situation/
## Comment #1


Letting your mother take the toddler to Hobby Lobby isn't high risk? Presumably your concern is that other people there may not be vaccinated? The risk to your toddler if they did contract it is incredibly low, and as long as they stay 2m away from other people (which isn't really that hard unless it's super packed, which large stores don't tend to be), and wash her hands regularly, it wouldn't be a problem for her to go. Now a large number of the population is vaccinated, it's okay to start loosening up on the previous year's restrictions.

# Any good news about all of this?


Created: 2021-06-09 13:34:15

This week, with cases of the Delta variant appearing among the unvaccinated, and re-appearing in countries that were almost normalized, such as the UK, I was extremely worried about the return of the world to normal.

As I've said before here, living in this condition of social isolation, especially for another 1 or 2 years is one thing, but not having the prospect of a complete return to a 2019 normal is quite another, when, for example, we will be able to go back to movie theaters full of unmasked people and conventions without worrying about dying or killing our close relatives?

https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/nvw2t1/any_good_news_about_all_of_this/
## Comment #1


Well, as you stated yourself, the Delta variant is appearing...among the unvaccinated. When more people will be vaccinated, it will fade. Also, giving all the second doses will help since it prevents spread a lot. It's not gonna take 1 to 2 years to finish the vaccine campaign. Maybe a few months, tops.

And eventually, as more and more people are getting vaccinated in the world, variants will appear at a slower pace.
## Comment #2


It will not be one to two years. I say by the end of the year  at the latest. By then barely anyone will be thinking about masks and who got vaccinated.
## Comment #3


things are already very close to normal again in many parts of the world. just get vaccinated when you can and start living again

if you're fully vaccinated, the variants shouldn't be any concern. like you mentioned, it's appearing among the unvaccinated (which there are still a lot of)
## Comment #4


It doesn't seem to be increasing deaths, which is what matters. The UK would be in a humanitarian disaster on the scale of India right now if vaccines weren't working against it. Compared with exactly this day last year, there are currently more daily cases but far fewer daily deaths.
## Comment #5


Where are you based? You may be getting a warped picture through the media of how 'bad' things are in the UK. Cases are up but deaths are still going down - the vaccine rollout is steaming along and at worst, the complete reopening that was originally intended for 21 June may (and it's not even certain) get delayed for a few weeks. The end-of-summer music festivals are still on, open-air theatres are popping up all over the place, most restaurants are open again... it's not far off normal.
