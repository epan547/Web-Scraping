# Highly Contagious Delta Variant of COVID Spreading in the U.S. | PEOPLE.com

## Comment #1


I have read that this variant is associated with severe and unusual symptoms such as gangrene from blood clots, hearing loss, severe GI distress in some patients. It is spreading rapidly in England, and hitting those age 12-20 particularly hard. It’s 40% more transmissible, according to preliminary reports. 

The Pfizer (and very likely the moderna) vaccines are 33% effective after one shot, but that number jumps up to 88% after two shots. England has prioritized people getting the first shot, and the second shots are often not available until 2-3 months later. It seems to me (not a scientist) that this is a big reason why it’s spreading rapidly there. In the U.S., it will hit those that are unvaccinated or have not followed through with the two shot regimen.

The big takeaway: get both shots and vaccinate teens and young adults. If you’ve done this, it appears that you will be fairly well-protected.

>	Fauci said that the variant may be "associated with increased disease severity" and a higher risk of hospitalization from COVID-19, but that the vaccines have been effective against it. A study from Public Health England found that people who were fully inoculated with Pfizer's vaccine had 88% protection against the Delta strain, NPR reported. A single dose of the vaccine offered 33% protection, highlighting the need for both doses.  

Get vaccinated or get sick. I don’t care, but stop fear mongering with the variant news that isn’t news.

Is this new variant seen under a microscope by US Universities? Or is it a ghost like the original "virus"?
