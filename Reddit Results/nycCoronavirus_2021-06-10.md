# ðŸ’‰How to get a Covid-19 vaccine appointment in NYCðŸ’‰


Created: 2021-02-10 00:59:29

So here is a quick list and tips I have made over the past few weeks to find the Holy Grail, feel free to share and add to it.

Bookmark those sites and check often (and refresh) for availability :

* [https://nycvaccinelist.com](https://nycvaccinelist.com/) a website made by volunteer to aggregate multiple sites of vaccination
* [https://www.turbovax.info](https://www.turbovax.info/) same as above, but they have a twitter account, so you can follow them[ @turbovax](https://twitter.com/turbovax) and set up notifications to be instantly notified when appointments open up.
* Follow @[nyshotslots](https://twitter.com/nycshotslots) as well to get notifications. [https://twitter.com/nycshotslots](https://twitter.com/nycshotslots) great account to keep track of the pop-up vaccination sites.
* Another twitter account to follow [https://twitter.com/NycVaccinate](https://twitter.com/NycVaccinate) (thanks u/thrifty_john) for real-time notifications and direct link to book appointments.

Super normal to ask those 65+ to click through 15 links, each with different login credentials, to scramble to find a slot. Truly a broken system.

Regardless, thank you for posting these resources.

How I just was able to get an appointment, since I was trying to use the twitter bots but every time I got to the schedule page the appointments were all taken:

&#x200B;

[Go to this link - it takes you directly to the NY H&H scheduling page.](https://epicmychart.nychhc.org/MyChart/SignupAndSchedule/EmbeddedSchedule?id=RES,11736948,11736949,11736950,11736951,11736952,11736953,11736954,11736955,11736956,11736957,11736958,11736959,11703875,11703874,11703367,11703868,11703869,11703873,11703870,11703871,11703872&dept=1012009896,1020009908,1015009901,1011009919,1021009929,1022008535,1013009914,1014009903,1023009916,1021009930,1024009929,1025009903,1022008534,1023009915,1055009828,1050009831,1051009831,1052000031,1053009828,1054009831,1051102309,&vt=11790692)

&#x200B;

Download an auto refresh extension for your browser. [On Chrome, I used this one.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/easy-auto-refresh/aabcgdmkeabbnleenpncegpcngjpnjkc)

&#x200B;

Set the auto refresh to every 5 seconds and press start. I had this up on one side of my monitor while I was working from home this afternoon and waited for a green box to pop up on one of the refreshes. Once that pops up and you got a time/location you like, stop the auto-refresh extension and schedule the appointment as normal by logging in with your MyChart credentials or as a guest.

&#x200B;

I got an appointment at bellevue that popped up before it even made it to any of the bots' twitter feeds. Hope this helps!

After receiving my second dose of the COVID vaccine today, I asked the nurses at Kings County Hospital if people 65 and older can get vaccinated here. They said MONDAY to FRIDAY (8-11 am) ANYONE 65 and older can WALK IN and get a vaccine. Just bring ID. The vaccination center is in Building T (Clarkson Ave). Tell your neighbors and family. They were nice and quick. They DO NOT have to stand in a line. They can come and sit down in a big waiting area. Very organized and FAST!

Just adding the information for the Armory in Washington Heights, Manhattan: https://vaccinetogetherny.org/Pages/default.aspx
For people 65+, with priority for people in northern Manhattan and parts of the Bronx.
## Comment #6


If i might add, I had the following done in 12 hours

1. Get a covid test at any of the NYC Health and Hospital sites.

2. When you take the test, they'll give you username and password to sign up to their portal My Chart. Step 1 and 2 are not necessary if you already have a profile with them. 

3. Follow Turbovax on twitter and turn on notification. He will give you appointments availability every few mins at any of the NYC Health & Hospitals locations. You have to be fast to click on the link but you'll make it withing 3 attempts. 

4. Once you complete the form, the systems will ask you to login to my chart with the credentials you obtained in step 2.

When does javits drop appointments?
## Comment #8


I've been seeing more and more open appointments in the coming days at pharmacies around me (Duane Reade mostly). Has anyone had success recently calling about waitlists or showing up around closing time and asking? I imagine with this number of open appointments in the coming days (I'm seeing almost all times available) they must have some extra doses available.
## Comment #9


Does anyone offer the service of getting you an appointment?  Iâ€™m now fully eligible. Donâ€™t want to skip any lines but donâ€™t have time or patience to try to refresh browsers all day and find an appt.
## Comment #10


Super annoys me that a business recipient of the vaccine requires people to sign up to their company site and get thrown into their marketing shit (including a "Id verification check") just to try and register for a covid vaccine
## Comment #11


After failing a couple of times to fill out the NYC H+H guest registration form fast enough, I ended up installing [this autofill Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/autofill/nlmmgnhgdeffjkdckmikfpnddkbbfkkk?hl=en).

My approach was as follows:

1. Keep refreshing the [NYC Health and Hospitals direct link](https://epicmychart.nychhc.org/MyChart/SignupAndSchedule/EmbeddedSchedule?id=RES,11736948,11736949,11736950,11736951,11736952,11736953,11736954,11736955,11736956,11736957,11736958,11736959,11703875,11703874,11703367,11703868,11703869,11703873,11703870,11703871,11703872&dept=1012009896,1020009908,1015009901,1011009919,1021009929,1022008535,1013009914,1014009903,1023009916,1021009930,1024009929,1025009903,1022008534,1023009915,1055009828,1050009831,1051009831,1052000031,1053009828,1054009831,1051102309,&vt=11790692) (using [this auto-refresh Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/easy-auto-refresh/aabcgdmkeabbnleenpncegpcngjpnjkc))
2. Wait until any appointment shows up as available (even if you have no intention of taking it)
3. Fill out the guest registration form and once completed, use the autofill extension to save form details
4. Go back to the H+H direct link, refresh until you find an appointment that you *actually* want
5. When you go to register, your details will be autofilled, saving you previous seconds

Consider adding NYS run Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens to the am i eligible bullet.
## Comment #13


Great news - I was able to grab an appointment for this Saturday. Huge thank you to the person who suggested using the auto-refresh chrome extension. I have an additional tip for those still struggling - I initially thought I was unable to make a MyChart account since Iâ€™ve never been to NYC H+H. However, I booked a covid test 3 weeks out and they immediately emailed me a sign in activation code (you can cancel the test appointment right after). I then kept MyChart logged in and open in a separate tab - when an appointment became available and I selected it, I was immediately redirected to the confirmation page. Best of luck to everyone!

I just called the NYC Health Department (877-208-8318) and after almost an hour on hold, my husband and I were able to get an appointment for Monday in Bed Stuy. Keep trying guys, there are still available appointments out there!
## Comment #16


Thank you so much for this list! 

I have a family member in their 50s who is recently in remission. I want to help get them an appointment once theyâ€™re eligible on feb 15. 

Does anyone know about when we can expect the sites to change to the newest phase? 

Has anyone had success making appointments at Walgreens or rite aid in Manhattan? Because they are recently in remission I think this setup may be more manageable than walking through an unknown hospital or a large site where they may be in contact with more people than necessary. 

Any tips would be much appreciated! I had luck making appointments for my older family members through the HH site but in their cases we were able to take first available and send them anywhere. Have to be a bit more cautious this time around.

Update: I was able to get an appointment at SUNY Stony Brook for the first week in March. Tried all morning and finally got pushed into a queue that I had to keep open for about an hour until they offered appointments. Anyone in a similar position just keep trying appointments are out there and do pop up! 

Seems the HH website has not updated to include the next phase yet. Hoping they have sooner availability when they do update but happy to have something atleast!
## Comment #17


Yassss!  Confirming that Turbovax works.  I signed up Weds and got vaccinated on the same day.  

What worked for me was, I have a MyChart account already from NY health+hospitals, so when I tried to sign up for the vaccine on my iPhone, the vaccine appointment went directly into my MyChart account because my login credentials were saved.  And voila.  I had an appointment after weeks of trying on the frustrating, clunky sign up websites.
## Comment #18


Thanks for creating this, just became eligible today with underlying condition so this is great information.
## Comment #19


Not sure if this is the appropriate place to make this comment, but it looks like NYC H+H are no longer accepting first dose appointments. They cancelled my motherâ€™s appointment and didnâ€™t inform her until she got there. Then, they updated the NYC Vaccine Finder website too.

This list is for leftover vaccines that will expire soon and notifies you if a location near you becomes available. It is very short notice (1 day to 2 hours). 

I signed up for a standby waitlist thru Dr. B(?) on 2/20, was 166,900th place in line or something, got a text on 3/4 saying there might be an availability the next day near me, got that text the next day where it asked me to show up within 2 hours. 

I did and was able to get the vaccine there (volunteer worker helped me sign up and everything was done in about an hour). 

Overall my experience was that it was very fast, no hassle (I didnâ€™t have to sign up thru multiple links), and professional/safe. 

Just wanted to post here if it might be helpful to anyone!

Anyone find a way to make a nyc h+h my chart account without ever having an appointment or covid test done?
## Comment #24


In re acpny: you do not require an activation code to register. Plow ahead and create a MyChart account with them. Youâ€™ll get access to appointments by logging in. Same calendar refresh rules as elsewhere.

I was able to snatch a slot with this bot (disclosure: made by a colleague).

Has less coverage than others, but is updated a few minutes earlier than other trackers.

This has been the hardest effort I have put in, over a month now and I cant get my (68) mom an appointment. Please help!!
## Comment #27


A truly big shout-out to the people who put this together. I really appreciate your help, couldn't have gotten a vaccine appointment for a loved one with nearly as quick results / as little headache.

There's still some good on the internet and still some nice people around, means a lot. Stay safe all.

I canâ€™t believe USPS postal workers in NYC (designated as essential workers by cdc) are not eligible for the vaccine

If your doctor is an NYU Langone doctor, you can schedule vaccine appointments pretty easily thru their app.
## Comment #33


*this question is about the consent forms;*    
so i got this link from Walgreens (where my Pfizer appt is); 
https://www.walgreens.com/images/adaptive/pdf/FY21_COVID19_VAR_InStore_ENG.pdf  
and i googled this link about consent;    
https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2021/02/vaccine-consent-form-2.12.21-0917.pdf  
so do i fill out and bring *one or the other or both forms* ?  
my eyes glaze over when i sense liability & bureaucracy.

Does anyone know if the Citi Field vaccination site checks if youâ€™re an official NYC resident? My temporary address is in Queens but my permanent address is in Nassau county, so Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m eligible
## Comment #35


I got my appointment offered vis email by NYC Health + Hospitals!!!
If you have MyChart account with any of the city public hospitals, you can get a spot through MyChart.
Canâ€™t wait for mine on Friday!
## Comment #36


I just scheduled an appointment at the City Point Vaccine Hub. In the email they sent, it says I need to bring a completed NYS Covid-19 Vaccine Form. The thing is, it's an online form. I already did it, but it said to "show this page to your COVID-19 healthcare provider before the vaccination". How am I supposed to do that?

PSA to anyone trying to book a senior an appointment (or are themselves 65+) Walgreens has good availability right now!

ETA: for any older people who had a first appointment somewhere really hard to get to, Walgreens has the option of booking second dose only. Just please cancel the original appointment you/they had!
## Comment #42


Mods, can we add a mychart tip for H&H? People that donâ€™t have a mychart account stand no chance getting an appointment cuz it takes too long to sign in as guest. 

You can get a H&H mychart account by scheduling a covid test on their website - they ll send you a mychart log in. 

Otherwise it takes 10 biz days to get an account set up

## Comment #44


any info yet for people who specifically want to get the JnJ 1-shot vaccine locally?

    some stuff i just learned today from a hospital worker;   
Cepheid PCR test is far more reliable at low viral loads than the Liat PCR test       
*they are seeing a lot of Liat negatives that a few days later are covid positive.*    
there is a spike in TB cases particularly within the Russian community    
covid wards are half full now, so hospitalization rates are truly lower    
*despite infection rates remaining above average.*

Does anyone on here understand why CitiField isn't popping up on the H&H website tonight?
## Comment #55


Can someone please provide me some help or insight? Refreshed the page for 4 hours straight today, a ton of appointments finally appeared. Every time I selected a time and auto-filled my info but still had to select gender, ethnicity, race, DOB and the program would glitch and send me back. I tried to make a NY H+H MyChart to make the process quicker but itâ€™s saying I have to have been to one of their hospitals before. I feel so frustrated and discouraged.

Edit: I also tried calling the hotline and she told me to go to a pharmacy for the vaccine (even though I had already told her Iâ€™m not 65+). She then offered to give me another health hotline number that may have more appointments and proceeded to give me her own number.

Is there a vaccine hunters group? I've been asking at wallgreen's if they have extra but I'm not of age.
## Comment #59


When will the vaccine be released for average people? I was told Iâ€™m not an essential worker, but I go to work everyday because my computer at work is broken and I canâ€™t remote in without someone manually turning it on.

Most people I know were vaccinated because they work at Burger King or are overweight, or both.
## Comment #60


any updates now? is there one good site?
## Comment #61


Hi! Not sure if anyone will be seeing this but I registered for the vaccine at a pop-up location and there wasnâ€™t an age limit. Iâ€™m also not working (in person), and the page said the vaccine was only being offered to NYC residents or people working in NYC. I also donâ€™t have any underlying health conditions so I guess Iâ€™m worried that theyâ€™re going to turn me away...
## Comment #62


[deleted]
## Comment #63


For those with underlying conditions, H+H locations should have all switched to having you sign a self-attestation form, meaning you don't need a doctor's note. They were the only locations I heard giving people a hard time up until Wednesday. They supposedly started accepting the form on Thursday and it should be provided at the location. 

To be on the safe side, of course a doctor's note would be useful but even without that, you can bring anything that proves you have the underlying condition and you can also use the doctor's office's app to show the relevant info there as well as prescriptions listed on your pharmacy app. Still, I think the official state guidelines now state the self-attestation form is all you need. They *may* spot check some calling up your PCP to ask (you have to list one on the form when you sign in).
## Comment #64


so what am I doing wrong? I'm 47 but perfect health and want a shot cause I carpool kids and will probably go back to work soon a few days a week

&#x200B;

all the NYC sites say some place has first dose available but when I click the link to make an appointment there are none available

I had my first shot taken at cvs far away and would like to switch to the Javits because of location.

How can undocumented immigrants without any documents/ID get vaccinated? [This website](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-vaccines.page#elgproof) lists forms of ID that can be used to prove eligibility for the vaccine.

but in canada they wait 4 months for a booster.*  
she has a long expired nystate drivers license.  

so what do you guys think, can she get it done?  
should she pretend it's her first shot when it's  
really her booster?  will they charge her money?

# Vaccine Experience Megathread?


Created: 2021-03-31 22:41:47

Not a mod, just a member, but a few of us started posting about vaccine experiences at particular sites.  I started to wonder if that would be of interest to anyone else?  It was nice to read others' experiences at my site before I went, and I was happy to share my experience afterwards.  

This would not be a how-to-make-an-appointment megathread, just about the actual jab experience.

EDIT: thanks for the sticky, mods!

## Comment #1


Arrived at Javits today at 1 for a 1:45 appointment. Went smoothly I was out the door after 45mins. Thatâ€™s with the 15 wait at the end. Line was constantly moving. I showed my registration and ID to a few people and it was done.

Arms pretty sore and I took a nap a few hrs later but donâ€™t have any other side effects right now. 

Thatâ€™s about it. Javits being the largest probably has this pretty streamlined by now. This was a weds afternoon so I assume there are busier times near rush hr and weekends.
## Comment #2


CVS in Queens in the afternoon. It was incredibly efficient. I had no wait for the shot and was out within 20 minutes!

I was a little over 15 minutes early but that didn't matter. At a table in the front of the store, a worker checked my ID, had me scan a QR card to fill out an online self-attestation, and then gave me my vaccine card. (I used my out-of-state driver's license for ID so I also had my residency proof, but they didn't ask to see any other documents.) They then sent me to the pharmacy area.

At the pharmacy area, there was another check in, a waiting area with a fair amount of people waiting post shot, and a curtained off vaccine administration area. They checked me in and asked which arm I wanted the vaccine in. I then walked straight behind the curtain to get vaxxed.

Post-vaccine I waited the 15 minutes and left. There were a fair amount of people coming in and out for vaccination. It was done very efficiently and never felt too crowded, and no one seemed to have to wait more than a couple minutes.
## Comment #3


Javits Center late afternoon today for my 1st shot. Arrived 25 minutes early. Did not wait in a line at any point in time. Was out, including the 15 minute wait, within 30 minutes. Incredibly efficient, with an insane amount of very helpful people guiding you through every step. 

There was no announcement regarding the 15 minute wait time. You should set a countdown timer on your phone.
## Comment #4


Got my first vaccine at Javits today. Appointment was at 11:30am but I got here a little after 10:30am which was not a problem. I am pregnant, so had to go through additional medical screening, but it was pretty straightforward. They did ask if I had consulted with my OB and if they were supportive and asked for their name. Any lines were very shortâ€”maybe 4 ppl ahead of me at medical screening and the same waiting to sit down to get the actual vaccine. 

There was a piano, cello, and violin trio playing during the 15-minute wait which was lovely!
## Comment #5


NYU Langone. 3pm, Thursday. Super quick, less than 10 minutes of waiting in line. Pfizer. It took longer to walk through the building than it did to wait for the vaccine. In the lobby, you approach a desk. Show them the email confirming your appointment (I used my phone). They'll give you a sticker and direct you to the vaccination area. There's LOTS of signs directing you where to go, because Langone is massive. I saw a few people in wheelchairs, so if you have mobility issues, maybe they lend you one? Not sure. Anyways, there are no stairs to deal with. 

Once you get to the vaccination area, If you haven't filled out the survey, you get into one line. If you have, you're directed to a computer kiosk to verify your identity. After that, another line. Mine was short, just 2 people. Then the shot, and then the waiting area for 15 minutes. Total time was maybe 25 minutes? No one is really monitoring the waiting area.

Besides the proof confirming my appointment, I wasn't asked to show anything else. The person who gave me the shot was super nice, and there's lots of people around directing and making sure things run smoothly. Good experience. 

I'm not sure how one gets into the Langone system, but they had a ton of available appointments and a lot of locations. They texted me once I was eligible, and I made the appointment via their app.
## Comment #6


Arrived at javitz at 8am today, 30 mins early for my appointment and they took me right in. No line at all and it was incredibly well organized, directed by the national guard. They didnâ€™t ask at the check in what I was there for but asked regular Covid questions. The nurses were super nice and only asked what I was there for, I replied for medical reasons and they didnâ€™t ask further. My shot was so painless, esp since gardasil was painful as fuck. They had me go over
to the medical evaluation to sit down for 15 mins before the guard told our group of people that we could go. Literally was in and out in 30 mins, by the time that my shot was actually scheduled. 

I would recommend not coming any earlier than 30 mins, also you can bring someone along with you for the whole thing I brought my mom just in case I passed out lol.

Edit: also I got Pfizer, they scheduled my next appointment 3 weeks away already, didnâ€™t have to do anything. Currently have a headache but I also didnâ€™t eat yet so ðŸ˜‚

Elmhurst Hospital. 

First dose, I arrived at 9:10am, got my shot by 10:35am, plus the 15 min waiting room.  While we waited on line, we were instructed to fill out a form and to show the email confirmation for completing the NYS Covid19 Vaccine form. If you didnâ€™t do that yet, theyâ€™ll show you a QR code to scan and you can complete it there. The line moved SUPER slow. 

When it was my turn, I was taken to a trailer where they take your information and schedule your second dose. They checked everything including my ID, insurance, and proof of eligibility. I was then directed to another area to wait for the shot and have my temperature taken. The shot was given in a private office. The nurse who gave me the shot asked additional questions including any allergies and if I took an vaccines recently. Finally I was taken to the 15 min waiting room where I was given a care package. When your 15 minute is up, your name will be called and you can go.

Second dose was at a different area of the hospital. I arrived at 1:15pm and was given a form to fill out. The form had a number on it and that will be your number on line. It also had a QR code on it that we had to scan for the NYS Covid Form. We were seated in an auditorium with social distancing while we waited. 

When your number is called, youâ€™re led down the hall to a room where they take your temperature, take your information and ask you covid related questions. I was then moved over to some seats by the walls where we waited for our shot. I got my shot by 2:10pm and was taken to the waiting room. After 15 minutes, theyâ€™ll call your name and youâ€™re good to go.
## Comment #8


Walgreens Flatlands (Pfizer) 

Took about 2 hours from entry to exit. The place was highly disorganized. No one from management told the people at the prescriptions desk that there were over 30 people in line for a vaccine. It took an hour and a half to get checked in. I filled out all of the forms prior to check-in and printed them out but they did not accept them, and I had to fill out some new forms again. Once I was checked in and forms were filled out it took less than 5 minutes to get the jab. They had a waiting area, which was pretty crowded, so I just waited in my car for 15 minutes before I left. 

The experience was pretty bad but I'm happy to get the shot!
## Comment #9


Got my second shot at Medgar Evers today. Just as fast, if not faster, than the first. All I needed was my vaccination card and driverâ€™s license. Tbh I felt the shot more this time, but I think I was more acutely aware of what to expect so I kinda got a little nervous/tense beforehand. Flawless experience though!
## Comment #10


Lincoln hospital in Bronx yesterday - showed up at 1015 for 1030 appointment, was out by 11. No line when I arrived but small line when I was leaving
## Comment #11


Did anyone drive to the Bronx co op one? Wondering how parking is or if there are lots close by
## Comment #12


Aqueduct today, first thing in the morning (Some really good luck, I was just idly checking the sites one last time before bed at midnight last night and snagged an 8am spot). 

I drove, and there was plenty of parking, but it was a little confusing at first because there weren't any signs at the front of the complex. You have to go all the way back. Then you'll see directions.

People were waiting outside when I got there, so I think we were the first appointments of the day. There were long empty zig-zag lines inside. Once they opened the doors I didn't wait at all.

They were doing Pfizer. My arm is pretty sore, but I'm also a big baby so it's probably nothing at all. Feeling just fine otherwise.

Overall a smooth and easy experience, very impressive, everyone was super nice! I'm really thrilled and blown away that all of this is even possible and feel super lucky right now.

Essex Crossing- waited maybe 15 outside. Empty storefront. A lot of vaccinators and a lot of aids guiding and helping people, it was incredibly efficient and fast.
## Comment #14


Centers Urgent Care in Coney Island today. Got there around noon. Thereâ€™s no line so my wife and I were out in under 30 minutes including the 15 minutes wait. The second shot appointment was scheduled to exactly 21 days later and we were told we could just come in anytime that day.
## Comment #15


I got mine at Dreiser Community Center in Co-Op city yesterday late afternoon. I live far away so ended up arriving early as traffic wasn't as bad as I thought. It was no problem to check in 20 min early. I don't have a NYC ID so they did ask me for proof of residency, and two pieces of official mail did the trick (stimulus payment letter and my w-2 from work). The place was not crowded and they had tons of staff to help direct you. If you have a needle phobia I did hear them coaching a few people through that and they were patient and really sweet. Not applicable to me, but I know a lot of people worry about that. 

The entire thing took about 30 min! And extra bonus for me that it was J&J, I'm really glad I won't have to go back for a second shot. I'm so relieved!!
## Comment #16


Got my first Moderna shot yesterday at Bronx High School of Science. I got there the time they told me to, five minutes before my appointment, and they told me to wait in line. It was about 15 minutes waiting outside, then they directed me in the building, got my shot, went to the waiting room for 15 minutes while people were walking around scheduling second doses. It was all very efficient and painless, I was able to stay a good distance from other people the whole time.
## Comment #17


Bronx High School of Science (Moderna)

My appointment was at 2:30, but I arrived early
at about 2:10. Wasnâ€™t an issue. The line was pretty long but it moved quickly. The workers were really nice and helpful checking everyone in and doing screenings. I came for my second dose, so I wasnâ€™t asked for any eligibility proof. However, I was asked when I went for the first dose. 

Once you get to the injector, they ask to review your information again (you have to present your ID and appointment number/barcode). Then you got the shot. You get a sticker and your vaccination card and youâ€™re off to the gym to be observed for 15 minutes. I was out the door by 2:47pm. Everything runs really smoothly at this site.
## Comment #18


Went to a cvs site Sunday afternoon. I was surprised I was able to find one when my demographic opened up on Tuesday. Went in, checked in at the entrance and was in line behind another person. Took about five minutes before I got my shot. Waited 15 minutes and noticed more people coming in, forming a line. Was glad I was in and out in less than 30 minutes.

I got a sore arm and felt woozy every now and then but I thinks that's more placebo effect on my part. Then again, I did have it last year so not sure what to think especially after reading anecdotes about the vaccine affecting us more harshly.

Either way my second shot lands on my birthday. So that's a really great gift to myself!
## Comment #19


Got to Citi Field yesterday at 4:25 pm finished by 4:50 pm. There were only 3 people on line in front of me. I prefilled everything online, don't know if that made any difference.
## Comment #20


Went to Javits on Thursday for my second shot. Showed up at 8:30 (my appointment was for later in the day). No issues and was able to get my shot in arm after like 12 mins from walking in. They didnâ€™t even ask me what qualified me. 

The side effects were pretty brutal for me (27M - never had Covid). 102.5 fever came on around 15-20 hours after getting the shot. Felt like crap for another day. Finally 48 hours later feeling mostly normal. Definitely plan ahead of time. I had run out of Tylenol so had to make a painful journey to CVS..

Edit: My girlfriend got her second shot and had zero side effects... amazing how much it differs person to person!
## Comment #21


just a telling anecdote for the times...       
i got my pfizer 04/01 and booster was set for 04/29      
cdc spanks walgreens over not doing 3 week spacing   
i call my walgreens and i says "pharmacists, if you have   
a cancel, i can be there in 20 minutes to get my booster."   
04/23 i got the call back, took the shot, and i'm done.    
they claim people may book multiple shots, later cancel  
so that is why they could open up the shot for me.

regarding post vaccine side effects;     
1st shot - mild sore arm for around 48 hours    
2nd shot - hours 12-36 whole body fatigued

month later update;    
walgreens has an app that when you look at your    
perscription history under vaccinations you can see   
you go what/when covid shot from there.  sadly   
they don't seem to reliably be exchanging info  
with nystate's excelsior system, and there does   
not seem to be any mechanism to fix this.
## Comment #22


I arrived at Bathgate just about exactly at my appointment time (7:45), and was immediately shown to a checkin table. The guy there checked my appointment and my ID (he didnâ€™t ask for any other paperwork, which I brought because my DL is out-of-state).

Then he showed me to the waiting area, which wasnâ€™t too busy. The second dose people were split up from the first dose people, and I saw a few second dosers skip ahead of the first dose lineâ€”so it seems like they prioritize the second dose people. That wasnâ€™t a problem, though, since I only waited for about 15 minutes.

Then I was brought into a room with a (very nice) nurse, who walked me through the details and then gave me the (Moderna) vaccine. I waited 15 minutes, in which time they scheduled my second dose for me, and then I left!

Probably about 45 minutes in totalâ€”super easy and everyone I interacted with was warm and efficient. Would definitely recommend this site. It was a long trek up from lower Manhattan, but a good enough experience that I probably wonâ€™t even bother trying to reschedule my second appointment.

Too early to say anything yet about side effects, but so far, so good.
## Comment #23


I got Pfizer at the HSS location at Martin van buren HS in queens village yesterday! Incredibly efficient - I was really impressed.

My appointment was at 320 - arrived a bit before 3 and was prepared to wait, but someone at the door checked my barcode and immediately let me in to the waiting area. I waited less than 5 minutes before being brought to a check in table - my barcode was scanned and I was asked if I filled out the NYS form. I had, so I showed the confirmation email. She was able to confirm on her tablet that Iâ€™d filled out the day of health screening.

She sent me to stand by one of the vax booths, and I was immediately called in. The HCP who gave me the injection was lovey - scanned my barcode again and was very friendly about everything. Answered the few questions I had, then sent me to the post shot waiting area with a sticky note that said what time I could leave.

In the observation area, I was directed on where to sit, and site workers walked around person to person scheduling second shots. Every few minutes one of the workers announced a time and said if our notes said that time, we could leave. I was done by 3:20!!

Personally felt like gaaaaarbage last night, just like I got hit by a bus, but felt much better today. Iâ€™m not 100% yet (just tired with an achy arm now) but Iâ€™m probably back at like 75/80%. Expecting to feel fine tomorrow.
## Comment #24


Canarsie Rockaway Parkway HS
Moderna

1210 appointment, fairly organized. they say not to arrive earlier than 5 mins but there were already people in line. They put you in line by time slots (every 10 mins) and you walk in when the time comes.

They first bring you to an area where they take your information. I had to provide id and work Id to show residency or work occupancy. Filled out a screening beforehand but they do it there if not.

You go to another area where you actually get the vaccine, they give you a card and you move on to the next area.

The next area is where you can schedule your next appointment, you can scan a QR code or have someone do it for you. Either way you have to wait 15 mins before you leave.

Overall pretty easy and well organized I thought. Done in like 35-40 mins. Iâ€™m not sure of other locations like pharmacies, but since this was a high school they were able to use the indoor space (cafeteria, hallways, auditorium, gym) Iâ€™d imagine the large vaccine sites and hubs are similar.

Arrived at NYC H+H Kingâ€™s Country at 4:31 for a 4:30 appointment. I was afraid I would be turned away for being late, but that didnâ€™t happen. Everyone assembled into a line and the workers gave us clipboards and pens to write down our information. He took the cards of second dose seekers. I donâ€™t have a NY ID yet so I brought my lease, but he didnâ€™t even look at that and asked me for my out of state ID and insurance card instead. We were then shuffled to a waiting room and waited to be called. I was called after about 10 minutes and got the shot in another room. Waited 15 minutes in the post examination room and then left. The whole process was about 45 minutes.

The nurse advised me that itâ€™s better to come early because she only had three vaccines left. The state doesnâ€™t want wasted vaccines and gave them the bare minimum. Definitely wouldnâ€™t be a place I would look for a walk-up appointment.

Edit: they also gave me a free goodie bad with medical masks, hand sanitizer, etc!

Went to Brooklyn Army Terminal this morning. Arrived about 20 minutes before my 545 appointment, and it was all super seamless. Fair warning it is a little confusing if youâ€™re parking on pier 4, as thereâ€™s no direct signage indicating where the site is. However when youâ€™re making a turn into the road that leads to the parking thereâ€™s a large sign on your left indicating thatâ€™s the location of the site.

Checked in at a booth and went to a small trailer where I was asked some of the clarifying questions on my eligibility, then was directed to a different trailer for the vaccine itself. Interesting to note my information wasnâ€™t checked once at all, only had the QR code scanned from the appointment email. Hardly felt the shot at all (moderna) and was directed to the observation area closeby. Got my second shot scheduled for the the first week of May and waited 15 min before being released. The whole site is open air which was great, and the entire process took 25 minutes from arrival to release. 10/10!

Javits today, Pfizer, 1st dose. Arrived at 7:50 for 8:15 appointment. Got pricked at 8:03 according to my card. 


Crazy, crazy efficiency! They checked my ID and I had to pull up the email that was sent which should have your patient ID at the top. That was it. I took bills, passport, just anything so that I wouldn't get turned away. 


Everyone was super nice, there's a big army presence that leads you around. They have an incredibly tight system.


It's been about 5 hours now and I'm still feeling fine. My arm doesn't hurt, I don't feel tired. And as I'm typing this, I am just knowing I'm jinxing myself and look forward to curling up and shivering in my bed later.


Totally worth it. I have felt such a wave of hope and happiness since getting the appointment last week (when it opened for 30+, I'm late 30's). I had been looking forward to this for a year and it's happening faster than I expected. They could have punched me square in the jaw upon entry and I would still have gotten the vaccine.


I might report back if I did actually jinx myself!

Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx (H+H site) today for my first dose. I became eligible on 4/6 and found my appointment through the H+H website the same day by sheer dumb luck at looking at the auto-refreshed appointment portal at the right time. I live in Manhattan (Chelsea) and took the subway to the site; itâ€™s conveniently located near the 149th St Grand Concourse station which serves the 2/4/5 lines, and is maybe a 5 minute walk from the station.

Got there at 4:45pm for a 5:15pm appointment, and was vaccinated by 5:45pm. Got on line at the courtyard and it moved very fast, they had us all fill out some paperwork while on line. Then about 30 mins later I was checked in at a front desk-like area, they checked my ID and insurance but otherwise didnâ€™t check proof of residence (although my city address is on the back of my license, and I brought mail/my lease just to be safe). They had me sign up for my second dose at this step, and wrote the date and time on the back of my vaccine card; they said that would serve as my appointment for that day.

Now, from there, it took about half an hour to get the shot because the fire alarm went off in the hospital. Right? Just my luck. But fortunately, there was no danger to us, we werenâ€™t evacuated, and I was able to get my vaccine, so allâ€™s well that ends well.

ETA: Appointment time, and I got Pfizer!

Javits center, lunchtime today. No line and everyone was really friendly. I barely felt the injection and itâ€™s been a few hours and no side effects. while I was waiting in observation a man next to me became unconscious and seized up a bit. The medical team responded incredibly quickly and calmly and he seemed to be okay by the time I was leaving. Very impressed with the set up

Got mine tonight at the armory - they didnâ€™t ask me for my health insurance but asked the person next to me. They asked my employment status and thatâ€™s it - does anyone know whatâ€™s up with that?
## Comment #32


I got my first Pfizer shot at the Ft Washington Armory yesterday.  You enter off 169th towards the Broadway end and there are people guiding you through the entire process.  Once you enter the facility, you go through a metal detector, but it isn't super sensitive as we didn't set it off with keys or phones in our pockets.  Then you get your temperature checked by making a fist in front of a scanner and they give you a health questionnaire and a pencil and send you along the outside of the track to the other end of the facility.  At the other end, they direct you to an available rep who checks you in.  I had to show my ID and insurance card.  The rep gives you a sticker to wear - mine was purple to show I was there for my first shot.  After I was done checking in, I was directed to a line taking me to the center of the track, which was half set up with people in cubes giving the shots and half with distanced chairs for waiting after the shot.  My shot giver went over all the health questions with me again verbally, although my SO's did not.  He had me drop my arm to my side, gave me the shot which barely even hurt, handed me a sticky with the time I could leave and sent me to the chairs to wait.  They have the big track clock running with the current time, so it's easy to watch that and tell when it's time to leave.  While we were waiting out our 15 min, a rep walked over to us and scheduled our second shot appointments.  We got there around 2:10pm and walked out at 2:40pm, so it was super efficient.  I was also really pleased to see that the people getting vaccinated were a diverse group - all different ages and races.  I left feeling very positive about the whole experience and happy that my neighborhood is on the rise for being vaccinated!  A day later and we both still have slightly sore upper arms.  Hopefully the second shot will go just as smoothly.

York College, Pfizer

&#x200B;

First dose 3/6/2021

Parking around the corner on Guy R. Brewer Blvd in a lot for free.  No line outside, was brought inside (upbeat music playing, and a community "we're all in this together" feeling)  Temperature taken and then paperwork and ID checked (got a smiley face drawn on my paperwork) inside a slight 15 minute wait as we wove through the lobby in theater style roping, then into the gym.  Was told to go to a lettered cubicle and sit down in the chair outside of it.  Within a minute or two was called in and sat at a station with the person who was giving my shot.  Asked which arm I wanted the shot in, I said left because the chair was already facing that direction.  They asked to see just one part of my paperwork, asked if I had any underlying health conditions, I told them my comorbidity.  Shot was given, card was handed to me with a wait time and return date and they told me to go wait in the distanced chairs on the gym floor.  I left after the 15 minutes.  Total time was about 35 minutes.  No real side effect, was tired, sore arm which I couldn't sleep on, and I had a "strange" feeling in my head the next day.  That's the only way I can describe it but was probably a mild headache.  Was fine the day after.

&#x200B;

Second dose 3/27/21

&#x200B;

There was literally no lines inside or out.  They were doing second shots only on this day.  Temperature taken and we were directed to walk right to the gym area and were seated outside the cubicles immediately.  About two minutes in I was called to a station asked which arm I wanted it in, the shot giver asked my age and to see my vaccination card.  Got the shot, was directed to wait 15 minutes in the distanced chairs, and I was out the door 15 minutes later.  Total time about 20 minutes.  No real side effects, less pain in arm that the first shot, but later that night I was tired, and I had a heavy feeling in all my extremities.  Was fine the next day.

&#x200B;

Take care and stay safe all.

City Point, Brooklyn.

First Shot 4/8/2021

Very quick and efficient, took about 20ish minutes (Including time to wait 15 min for observation). They also scheduled your second dose right there which seems to always be exactly 4 weeks later on the same day (you can change the time online using the reschedule option with your appt code).

Right now (following morning), I still have a very sore arm. Does anyone know when this will go away?

Medgar Evers Brooklyn Pfizer First dose 30 min. National Guard super efficient. Filled out online form ahead of time (can also do it onsite) and bring ID (w/Brooklyn address). They will reschedule you 3 weeks out. Sore arm and mild headache for a few days.  Second dose 30 min. Filled out online form ahead of time and bring ID and vaccination record. Sore arm, chills, low fever and swollen lymph nodes. A few extra days of headaches but all good now.
## Comment #37


Got my second shot at Aqueduct today. Appt was around 4p. I've heard that you can show up at any time with the second shot but I had a conflict so I chanced it and arrived around 1p. Good timing because it seemed like I caught a lull and didn't have any issues getting past the checkers even with the later appt time. In and out again in under 30 minutes including the observation period. Not bad and even better they had stickers this time so I got one! I think that was the second highlight, first being that the second shot is finally done. Aftereffects is the same so far shortly afterwards: left arm slightly sore, left side of neck feels a bit tense. Will follow up with anything worse if it happens.
## Comment #38


Flatbush YMCA 3/31. My appointment time was for the first slot of the day. Handful of people waiting and they didnâ€™t open until appointment times, but it only took ten minutes to get through the check in line and into a shot chair getting Pfizer. Everyone was absurdly nice and patient. They scheduled my next shot while I was waiting the 15 minutes. Great experience!

My arm was sore but thatâ€™s it. Apparently the second shot is the tougher one. Weâ€™ll see!
## Comment #39


Had a 2:15pm appt at the Aqueduct today for my first dose. Got there at about 2:10, waited in a quickly-moving line and was directed to a desk to provide my ID and confirmation number and sign a consent form. I got the shot at about 2:35pm, received my CDC card and was asked to wait 15 min before leaving

# Weill Cornell, Belfer Vaccination Center

Just got back, was overall very quick and easy.  If you are having trouble finding an appointment that isn't too far in the future at the city / state sites and pharmacies, make an account with Weill Cornell.

## Registration

As advised by another thread in this sub, and my coworkers, I made an account directly on their patient portal, as Weill Cornell's appointments aren't listed on any of the vaccine finders as far as I can tell.  Sign up was quick and easy.  There is a big clear button on the patient portal for COVID vaccine sign up once you make an account and log in. You can select "Any Location" and "Any Provider," to see all available appointments at all locations. The sign up process is pretty standard, you just put in all your details and you're good to go. Once you get your appointment, make sure you write down the address of the site you're going to, as depending on which one you do, it may not be super easy to look it up without logging back into the patient portal.  I showed up an hour early and there were no issues, but when I showed up there was almost nobody there, and I noticed a lot more people coming in as I was leaving, so YMMV.

## Reception

The "Belfer" vaccination center isn't actually in their hospital, it is in what appears to be an academic building.  This was a little confusing, but just go to the right address, walk on in, and there will be people there to point you in the right direction.  I brought multiple proofs of residency, but didn't need any of them.  They simply checked my name off a list, handed me a form, I filled it out, then they entered my info in the system and sent me upstairs.  The lines were minimal at every step of the reception process.

## Vaccine

Once I was in the system, I was given a "Visitor" sticker, and told to stand in line for a nurse to call me in.  I only had to wait a few minutes.  Once I got seated in one of the vaccination areas, it was just a quick set of questions to double check that there were no medical reasons why it could be dangerous for me to get the vaccine, and then I got the shot.  I was given a sticker with my departure time and my vaccination card, and told to walk over to the observation area.

## Second Dose & Waiting

As I walked into the observation area, I was directed to a desk where I got my second dose appointment, then sat down for my 15 minutes before I got up and left.

That's about it.  Very quick and easy.  I've heard that lines are getting longer at the big sites, so you may want to look into the smaller sites if getting in and out in a hurry is important to you.

York College 04/14/21

I arrived at 2:45PM, I showed my ID and appointment confirmation and was able to walk in right away. There was a very short line before I was able to sit for my shot. After the shot I waited in the center area for 15 mins and then left. (They don't time you for your waiting period, people just left themselves.) I barely felt the shot at all, the staff were very nice and organized. I left by 3:10 PM.

One of the women in the waiting area did seem to be having some sort of reaction. She had someone with her, and the staff calmly helped them. I couldn't tell exactly what happened but they took her in a wheelchair to another area.
## Comment #42


I'm sure this has been posted to death but husband and I went for our first shot of Pfizer at Javits Center on 4/13 in the morning. Absolutely no wait. Just kept moving along the entire time since we got there. The vaccine person was amazing, maybe I'm just having war flashbacks with my tetanus shot from 2 years ago that made my arm a limp noodle for 2 weeks...but this one I'm already barely feeling it 2 days later!

As far as side effects - none! Just a bit of arm pain on the injection site that was painful 12 hours after. I'm guessing I will be hit like a truck with my 2nd shot  in May.  Husband had some body aches/fatigue but that basically aligns with the covid symptoms that he had a month earlier.

Here's a quick breakdown:

1. Walk in the 2nd set of doors that don't say "EXIT" on them.
2. Army dudes will tell you to follow the arrows, you can come with someone. Husband & I came together and they let us sit at the same tables every single time. His appointment was actually 45 minutes after mine but they didn't have issues with us going together at the same time around the time of my appt.
3. Was only asked to show ID and print out of the confirmation from the email/website.
4. Got our shots done at the same table one after the other. Was told to come back on the same day at "any time" for the 2nd dose but the email confirmation we got later that day just put the exact same time as our first shot.
5. Followed more arrows to sit in a large area  with chairs about 5 feet apart (maybe it's supposed to be 6 but it felt like 5!) One old man had to be wheeled away because they said he had diabetes. Hope he made it through. We just kinda sat there for 15 min and then got up and left.
6. Free mini water bottles on your way out.
7. Right before you leave you can leave a thank you note on their board :)

I've been fully vaccinated as of 3 weeks ago when Yankee stadium was a super site and this is my experience. I got a 7pm appointment during a football game it may have been the superbowl but I'm not a big sports fan so dont quote me on that. 

I arrived a bit earlier than my 7pm appointment  at 6:30pm and was greeted by a bunch of National Guardsmen where I was asked if I had an appointment which i did. I made my way through the cheese maze where I encountered a magnetometer and was asked to place all of my metal items in a bucket I complied. 

After retrieving all of my metal items and composing myself I headed in to the stadium where I was directed to a lady behind plexiglass shield  and a tablet who asked for my ID which I provided. She took my ID entered in some information then directed me to a nurse's station where I was greeted by a nurse.l

They didn't have any vaccines available at that moment so we engaged in conversation for about 10 to 15 minutes before a National Guardsmen showed up with 2 syringes one for my nurse and one for another nurse.

She prepped my arm with an alcohol swab and  injected me with my first dose of Pfizer's vaccine. I had to wait 15 minutes after the injection to see if there were any side effects of the vaccine.

 I didnt go home afterwards I decided to go grocery shopping and I felt really good afterwards. A day later my arm felt sore and had a small lump at the site of injection. Other than the sore arm that was the worst of any side effects that I had going forward. If you want a synopsis of the second dose experience let me know.

Finally second dose time!  I don't know about anyone else, but the three weeks between my doses absolutely crawled.  

Got my second dose at Elmhurst last week.  The site opens at 7am, and I got there a few minutes after.  My appointment was at 7:30, but when I got my first dose, I heard a nurse tell another patient to just come any time on the day of your second shot--they take people in the order they arrived.  Therefore, my plan was to get there first thing.  I don't live close to the hospital, so it was an early morning subway adventure.  I was actually too excited to sleep much the night before, so an early morning was just right.  I really wanted this vaccine!

We were taken into an auditorium to fill out the form (same as for the first dose.)  There were at least a half dozen friendly, energetic Elmhurst employees who were buzzing around the room making sure people understood what they needed to do and providing translation help when needed.  My form had a number, 25, on the top,  People must have been lined up waiting to get in because I arrived at, like, 7:03 or something like that and there were already 25 people ahead of me.  The called people into the check-in and vaccine area in groups of about \~6, in the order that you arrived.  Again, extremely kind and friendly people working the desk.  I sat down to wait for a few minutes, got called in with the nurse--again, very kind and chipper (Elmhurst must go out of its way to employ morning people, LOL!)  The nurse told me that after the past year she's really enjoyed working the vaccine clinic and it's been emotional to see everyone so excited to get the vaccine.  I bet!

I was taken to the observation area, and was back out on the sidewalk by 7:48am.  I was back home a little before 9.

i got lucky and caught pfizer at walgreens near my home.    
the whole process took maybe 10 minutes, and my arm  
was mildly sore for a day.  my booster is set 4 weeks but  
they may change it to 3 weeks due to the cdc comment.  
https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/walgreens-not-following-u-s-guidance-on-pfizer-vaccine-spacing/ar-BB1fjIqp  
i just bought these for my family and to give away to friends;      
https://www.amazon.com//dp/B01N18SWVZ  ($10 black 25pcs)       
my guess is we'll have to wear our cdc cards for indoor dining,    
maybe even going to the barber or doctors office,  so i figured  
i'd post about them here for my post vaccinated local homie.

## Comment #48


I got my first dose at a pharmacy. I'm going tomorrow to get my second dose at a state run site. Their appointment booking system didn't give me a way to say I just wanted a second dose (since I lacked a confirmation number from the state system), so I just booked a first.

Has anyone else done this? What happened? My main concern is that they turn me away when I clarify this up front, or that if I don't, that they refuse to itemize my second dose on my existing vaccination card (from the pharmacy).

Thanks for reading!
## Comment #49


Curious if anyone from out-of-state has had their vaccine in NYC. I'm currently here and would love to get the shot but don't have any proof of residence (nor do I work or study here). Are they even checking for proof of residence?

I think concerns will continue about some of the vaccines not approved for use in the US. I'm sure AstraZeneca is an acceptable equivalent, but some others are not proving to be.

Also, vaccination is not 100% effective and foreign visitors might be carrying strains that are new to the US.

I use the pass for business, and I only accept appointments for on-location work if the client has a pass. The idea works. It makes a big difference already.

the arguments against go from idiotic to vague but mostly idiotic. What I like is that the info stays protected within the state.

and it works fine, beautifully actually.
## Comment #4


If I understand correctly, the intention is that it will be more than a "Vaccine Passport". That $17 milion is the potential total cost of a system that can serve as proof of age, a driver's license, etc. It's an electronic alternative (or replacement) to the paper documents we hold today.

I don't know the complete details of the Excelsior Pass's vision and roadmap, but I am absolutely _for_ moving towards a world with electronic IDs and passports. I HATE having to carry an ID card. I HATE having to carry a paper passport when I travel. I am a naturalized immigrant and my passport is my only proof of citizenship, so losing it would be a massive headache. I know Excelsior Pass cant possibly replace my passport since it is a state project, but it could be a pioneering project that moves us a step forward in that direction.

The $17 million price tag doesn't even seem that large when you actually think about what you are getting. It's a digital ID system that can scale to a potential 20 million users. That's a cost of less than $1 per potential user. I paid a hell of a lot more than a dollar when I needed to replace my state ID or when I wanted to upgrade to a Real ID.

Even when proofs of vaccinations are no longer necessary, I see immense potential value in this if executed properly. I have been hoping for digital IDs to replace physical IDs and passports for a long time.
## Comment #5


the excelsior pass allowed my business to reopen and get out of the nonsense of the remote joke for a small service like mine. Now we can service with confidence and re-organize .

the remote thing for services was a disaster: first they don't like to pay (remotely) second you and your people end up working 24H on-call and they called at any time of the day or night.

Now we check the pass, set the appointment and get paid when the job is done as it should be.

It saved my business and the lives of my people.
## Comment #6


Yep.

Color me shocked. The Execrable Piss project has a phase 2 (fortunately only funded at $2.2 million, which is peanuts for a government project) that allows the app to provide more identifying info than just name/DOB and vaccine status (which are bad enough if they're logged habitually along with the location being checked into). Gov. Greasy and IBM seem to want to turn this into some sort of universal digital ID system that's used to "swipe into" ever more places of public accommodation.

Sheesh, and people called me paranoid for saying this can be abused and extended beyond the immediate public health emergency. Remember, the media is trying to create the perception of a national crime wave. If having people "swipe in" everywhere prevents crime and helps cops solve crimes and quell civil unrest, what decent person could possible be against that?

Social credit, here we come. Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

All this being said, most other US states (including our neighbors) aren't so willing to take this heinous abomination of an idea and run with it, so vaccine verification will be mostly paper for the foreseeable future. Hope this flops the way that contact tracing apps have mostly flopped.
# Help with COVID testing site legitimacy


Created: 2021-06-08 16:27:20

 I recently got tested at a NYC Test & Trace Corps location and they were asking me a lot of specific questions, like my religion and ethnicity, which I thought was random, but didnâ€™t think much of. But then they proceeded to ask me for my SSN, which I stupidly gave without asking why it was necessary (they also asked me about where I worked). Upon asking friends and family, I discovered that no one else ever had to provide SSN when getting tested at the SAME location. Iâ€™m really worried now that I mightâ€™ve gotten scammed and Iâ€™m unsure what to do. The location is affiliated with NYC Health + Hospitals so I thought it was a trusted location and initially didnâ€™t think twice about giving them valuable information. Did anyone ever have a similar experience or have any advice on what I should do?

Edit: after contacting 311 and being transferred multiple times, I ended up talking to the assistant health director for NYC health and hospitals corporations. Apparently, itâ€™s protocol to ask these questions when recording you into the health system as a first time â€˜userâ€™ and that these questions are asked on a normal basis. The assistant director said that the person who asked these questions were right to do so, and that is the way it should be, and that the SSN is used to make sure they have the right person, since other information might be wrong. She also said that patients arenâ€™t required to provide this info. I guess I feel a little better, but itâ€™s still weird overall.

Created: 2021-06-09 03:57:27

I'm gonna be in NYC for about a week before flying out to the UK and I'll need to get my second shot there. I was wondering if anyone knows if it's a problem for someone from out of NYC (California) to get the vaccine. Also, does NY let you get the second shot early if you have to? I need to travel ASAP so I was wondering if walk-ins or appointments are strict about it being 21 days onwards only.

Not sure if this is for every state. I received my first shot in NYC (home) and was able to receive my second shot in New Mexico (visiting family). All they asked to see was my vaccination card from my first shot showing the date I received it.

You can give a fake name get a shot and go

Looking to hear about everyone elseâ€™s experiences getting vaccinated. Iâ€™m going to get mine soon! (Still considering which vaccine tho)

It depends on the person, but I know that 33,309 New Yorkers have passed away due to COVID-19. I cry every September 11th, and ~~in the past year,~~ we've lived through **Eleven 9/11** in the past 15 months. 

Everyone, please get vaccinated save other people's lives and yourself as well.

the vaccines are all good. I had the Pfizer 2 shots at Walgreens. I didn't feel anything. Go for it, definitely. Don't worry.

Got Pfizer,
Didnâ€™t have any bad reaction neither 1st shot nor the 2nd one. Just soreness in the arm, but not that bad, it felt like after the gym workout, just some muscle soreness
## Comment #5


*yawn*

Thereâ€™s already thousands of posts on the internet about vaccine symptoms and, to a greater extent, people over analyzing the simplest of symptoms and blaming it on the vaccine. 


Once you get the vaccine youâ€™ll know what experience youâ€™ll have.

It's anecdotal and all over the place really; my flu shot symptoms were worse. I got the Pzifer and had fatigue for a few days and a sore arm after my first dose. I felt fine after the second. A couple people I know who got the J&J only had a sore arm, another felt like garbage for 24 hours. Really just get your shot and don't worry about it.
# NY State To Lift Most COVID Restrictions Once 70% Of Adults Partially Vaccinated

People forget that opening/closing was always about our hospital system not being overwhelmed so there was always a triage aspect to it.
## Comment #2


On /r/nyc everyone is complaining why 68.7% is not good enough and 70% is. Then you come here and everyone is complaining that 70.0% is not enough.
## Comment #3


Can't come soon enough
## Comment #4


I personally don't see why we can't wait until 70% of adults are *fully* vaccinated. But whatever. The new CDC mask guidelines haven't seemed to cause any spike, so hopefully things really are safe enough for this.
## Comment #5


I really wish we weren't rushing through this. It should be 70% fully vaccinated, and the 70% partially vaccinated should've been the first marker for easing some of the safety measures/mask mandates/capacity limits, etc.

Kids 0-11 can't be vaccinated, 12-26 (I think), is the lowest vaccinated group. We need time to catch up and get people fully vaccinated.

Those of us who are vaccinated but immunocompromised have unknown protections. Maybe zero or close. We depend on people being *fully* vaccinated.

I know mine is a skewed perspective, so I admit that, but I feel like somewhere like California is getting it right in not just swinging the gates open and leaving us on our own.
## Comment #6


Right now we are at about 500 new cases in the state a day. Hopefully by then weâ€™re at less than 100.
# Question about Tourist getting Vaccinated


Created: 2021-06-08 18:18:04

Does anyone know if there any updates or resources stating that tourist from out of NYS or foreigners are able to get the J&J vaccine as per DeBlasioâ€™s news conference on May 6th?  Iâ€™m asking as some of my relatives out of the states would be visiting NYC at the moment.

It seems that itâ€™s still not the case yet based on this quote below from the transcript, as NYC seems to be waiting for NYS to change the eligibility.  But have anyone here anything further yet?

https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/339-21/transcript-mayor-de-blasio-holds-media-availability

â€œIt makes sense to put mobile vaccination sites where the tourists are. That is good for all of us that they get vaccinated. It's good for them. It's another reason to be here and know you're going to be taken care of. So, we're going to be setting up these mobile vaccination sites where tourists go. We'll be using the J & J vaccine. Weâ€™ll be in Times Square, Brooklyn Bridge Park, Central Park, the High Line, a variety of locations. And we're going to be working with the State of New York. We need the State to alter the rule that will allow us to provide vaccination to folks from out of town. But we think this is a positive message to tourists â€“ come here, it's safe, it's a great place to be, and we're going to take care of you. We're going to make sure you get vaccinated while you're here with us. So, this is going to start as soon as we get that approval. We're ready to go this weekend. We want to welcome more and more people into the vaccination effort. â€œ

They don't even have to get J&J.  NYC is no longer checking residency for any vaccine type, so they can get Moderna or Pfizer if they're staying > 3 weeks, and plenty of places are doing walk-ins, no appointment needed.  They need ID just to prove they're over 18 to get the vaccine without a parent or guardian, though even without ID, they can probably sign an affidavit if they look of legal age.

https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-vaccine-eligibility.page <-- local ID is not required, foreign passport is OK.
