7-DAY AVERAGES

New cases:  214 (up from 203 yesterday, down from 248 one week ago)

Deaths:  7 (up from 6 yesterday and 5 one week ago)

Positive tests:  1.56% (up from 1.51% yesterday, down from 1.73% one week ago)

Active cases (daily, not an average):  1585 (down from 1685 yesterday and 2403 one week ago)

Last Wednesday's report was pretty clearly still a full reporting lull from Memorial Day weekend, so I wouldn't read too much into the new cases and deaths averages going up. Tomorrow's report will be more relevant because last Thursday's report was basically back to normal.

Thanks for continuing to do this.

7-DAY AVERAGES

Note:  We did not have daily reporting one week ago (the report from 6/1 was actually for 5/31 data) so I'm not doing certain week-over-week comparisons today; that will resume tomorrow. However since the combined 6/2 report (reflecting 6/1 and 6/2 together) had zero deaths, I can include that number.

New cases:  203 (up from 195 yesterday)

Deaths:  6 (same as yesterday, down from 7 one week ago)

Positive tests:  1.51% (up from 1.48% yesterday)

Active cases (daily, not an average):  1685 (down from 1860 yesterday)

The slight increase in new cases and positive tests the last couple of days is hopefully just a result of reporting being so low over Memorial Day weekend altogether. We didn't start getting more normal reporting until Thursday last week, so at that point we will be able to see if we are actually getting a new mini-spike among the non-vax population or if it's simply a result of low reporting over Memorial Day. Active cases are still declining, which is a good sign.

Down to just 11 Counties not in the blue.

I was wondering about the false positive rate of test and how it could impact the numbers.  I've seen a false positive rate ~0.5%.  As we approach positivity numbers of 1%, that will make up a significant portion of the tests.  I wonder if there will be any guidance on getting tested twice.

This is the essence of Minnesota. Never best or worst at anything, but always a bit better than average.

I saw a map on twitter with vaccination rate by state.  There were several comments about how it seemed to align with Red vs Blue states.  That got me wondering so I pulled the data from the CDC on vaccination rates and from wikipedia on the election results by state.

- The % of Votes that went to Biden by state on the x-axis

- The % of people that have gotten at least one dose of the vaccine on the y-axis.

- The red dashed line is a 1:1 line.

- The blue line is a line fitted to the data.

I honestly didn't think it was going to correlate as well as it did.  Minnesota is about in the middle.  No states are really outliers.

- I'm guessing New York and California fall below the line due to the sheer number of people.  I'm curious about Maryland though.

Edit: Just a reminder that correlation is not causation and that at least 90 million people that did not vote Biden have gotten the vaccine. Biden got 81M votes while 171M people are vaccinated.  In fact, more people are vaccinated than voted any way.

Thank you for all the support I have received on these post over the last year! For those that are interested, I just graduated high school, and will be attending the University of Minnesota TC for mathematics (CSE) in the fall. With this summer, I hope to have some more time to improve these daily updates, as I have not done that in a while.

Thank you for doing these! I recall stalking this subreddit for your post when our numbers were so bad last fall/winter. Now itâ€™s fun to see how good we are doing. Congratulations on your graduation and good luck at the U- I got my undergrad there and loved it!

Notes:

- Vaccination fells below tests for the first time in the past few months.  Tests were also the lowest they've been since the start.
