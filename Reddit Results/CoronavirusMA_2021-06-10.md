It would take roughly 22,376 MBTA Commuter Rail cars to fit every fully vaccinated MA resident.
## Comment #2


The past year has been a tragedy but I am very proud of the people in this state
## Comment #3


Happy Wednesday!

Of note: It looks like we had a zero death day on May 30th!

Under a hundred cases! Incredible. Wishing everyone currently hospitalized a safe recovery.

# How do I get Walgreens to stop calling me about a second dose? (more info in post)


Created: 2021-06-09 14:52:24

<mark>So I had my first dose at a health clinic back in April and my second dose at Walgreens in May. I keep getting automated calls from Walgreens saying I need to schedule my second dose, so I think there must be a mix-up in their computer system since I only had one dose with them.

I'm not worried about the calls per se, I can keep ignoring them, but my concern is that my name is in some sort of state-wide record of people who have only had one shot, and if that's the case I'd really like it removed.

I just tried calling Walgreens, pressed 1 for COVID vaccine information and eventually got transferred to their call center. The person I talked to could not have been more unhelpful, they barely spoke English and told me they couldn't help me and I needed to call some other number, but they didn't know what that number was.

Does anyone know which number I need to call or anything else I can do to fix this error?

## Comment #1


Yes the same happened to me. I called 877-250-5823 and whatever she did solved the issue and stopped the calls

I got my first at Walgreens and second at CVS, so that’s why I was on their ‘list’ or whatever. But I know my insurance and doctors office is updated with the fact that I got both doses, so I’m not too concerned about somehow being down as only partially vaccinated
## Comment #2


This might not work but something to try. Book a 2nd shot appointment with Walgreens online. then immediately cancel it with the reason that you got your second shot elsewhere.
## Comment #3


What if you go into the physical store where you got it and ask them? I think you're correct you're gonna keep getting various outreach calls if you're listed as half vaccinated.
## Comment #4


Last year I got my shingles vaxx 1st at CVS then 2nd at Walgreens. Walgreens still thinks I need another dose. It’s not a big deal and there isn’t a centralized list anywhere.
## Comment #5


Call 1 800 walgreens its the hq number
## Comment #6


Just go in and bring your card!

Unfortunately my brother was one of the covid deaths in MA he was only 31. It’s calming down but the impact is still felt
## Comment #2


Today's helpful context: There are less current probable cases in MA than there were people in attendance at Oil Can Boyd's 2005 pitching appearance for the Brockton Rox at Campanelli Stadium.

## Comment #5


The "two more weeks!" crowd seems to have disappeared.
## Comment #6


i wonder what the probability is that someone who got 1 shot, will not return for a 2nd.  I'm assuming that everyone who got the first one is committed to vaccination, but have there been any unusual trends with people abandoning after the first dose?
## Comment #7


They have complete control over our actions due to how heavily they can influence a mass of ppl to believe that this is getting any better. May not be as bad certain places, but remember there's a whole world at stake many countries have "other variations" of the virus. Too many questions unanswered to believe that this so-called "vaccines"are gonna work out. Don't here much about better eating habits or even lifestyle changes (physical fitness....etc.). Yet many can FULLY trust a shot or 2 made up of what? Composed with what properties? At least if your living a healthy lifestyle you can control what goes through you. Idk tho... we never relied on the planet before, we just take from it and kill it. Good luck to those who believe in this atrocious society we live in.

Sorry this isn't as visually appealing as the good stuff from our resident data experts!

I just saw the post the other day about New England vaccination rates, and was curious if it was having any impact on cases/deaths.

Please let me know if you'd like to see future updates on this, and any ideas for improvement.
## Comment #2


It’s almost like… the vaccines work..
## Comment #3


I guess this is worth continuing to put up with Boston winters!
## Comment #4


I don't see it, so I assume the answer is no, but is this at all adjusted for tests per capita or percent positive tests?

Many places in the US appear better than they really are if you only look at case numbers because testing is so low.  See states like Florida where there aren't many tests being done and percent positive is typically 3+ times what it is in MA.
## Comment #5


Way to go New England- this is fucking awesome! Yooohoo, other states, try to catch us…

What's up with Maine? They're as vaccinated as Massachusetts, but their case count is more than twice as high.

It’s almost like intelligence is a good thing.
## Comment #10


Grateful to live in NE, and this is plainly great news.  Question....what's the right way to think about the 1.35 deaths/pop number?  On the one hand, it is 2x the same measure for New England....good for NE!  On the other hand, it's also a pretty small number, no?  Perhaps the point is that 0.67 is on the way to almost 0 and 1.35 is on the way to....still being 1.35 for a long time to come?

So how low can the hospitalizations go realistically? I doubt they go to zero ever so what’s the bottom?

Also, any idea how long MA will keep posting these reports?

# PSA don’t be a jerk to anyone who still wants to wear a mask


Created: 2021-06-06 04:09:44

Getting my floors done and my husband and I decided to stay in a hotel with our children. The last night I was there some guy really had a bad attitude and looked like he couldn’t control his angry because I was wearing a mask. Even asked me if I was a nurse but at that time I wasn’t really paying attention to him as I was asking the front desk person for something. The girl who he was with calmed him down just enough to not say anything to me but he was still angry and talking shit as I was walking away. Don’t make someone wearing a mask your business. It literally does NOT effect you in anyway. I am fully vaccinated and still decided to wear one that’s my choice.

## Comment #1


Imagine having absolutely nothing better to do than worry so much about what other people do that makes them feel safe? Gross
## Comment #2


> Even asked me if I was a nurse

Which is funny because these are the very people who were screeching about asking your vaccination status being a "~~HIPPA~~ HIPAA violation" (it's not)
## Comment #3


<mark>I'm traveling this summer to visit family in less-vaccinated areas and I'm already dreading squaring off with strangers about wearing a mask. Like, it literally effects your life zero percent if a stranger is wearing a mask but I know I'm going to get comments about it.</mark>
## Comment #4


<mark>I work as a cashier in a busy supercenter. I want to continue to wear a mask, because of the crowds. Last night I had to listen to two unmasked women talking about, how they are not "going to live in fear" and they want to build up their immunities. It's awful, I can't really say that much to them since I can't really argue with customers.

A few people have even asked: Does the company force you to wear a mask? To my knowledge it doesn't. I sometimes mention that I have COPD, which makes me immune compromised. Then, customers just reply: You should stay home.

People should just mind their own business.</mark>
## Comment #5


This entire situation is like a twilight show episode. I mean seriously?  People all stirred up about people wearing a mask?  Ever think it’s hard for people to just flip the switch like that over a year of what we just went through?  Not to mention still having people who don’t want the vaccine because of Facebook?  

The fact that mask wearing itself ever became a lightning rod for controversy is pure insanity. As if the concept of a mask itself was some new radical discovery.  Just absurd.
## Comment #6


I had an interaction at Dunks last week where a guy asked me why I was wearing a mask. I didn’t think he was taking to me, but when I realized he was I just pointed at the staff and said, “because they are and they have to work here all day.” He got pretty nasty and kept calling me a sheep. Whatever man, I’m a public librarian. People say horrible shit to me on the regular, but those same people are my medically vulnerable patrons. I’m going to keep wearing my mask indoors when I can’t distance for a while yet so I can protect them.
## Comment #7


It's also good to remember that some people still need to wear a mask if they want to follow the regulations. People that aren't fully vaccinated, or can't get vaccinated for whatever reason still are supposed to wear one.
## Comment #8


7 million people in Massachusetts... and probably 1 million of them are dumber than rocks. Try not to let every dumb person ruin your day.

On one level, it really pisses me off that 30% of the people in this country don't understand that by not getting vaccinated they are allowing the virus to mutate and become more infectious and nastier. But I chill because I understand that the dumb people will always be amongst us... And it has become political... and some of those people are legit crazy...
## Comment #9


I still plan to wear a mask at stores for quite a while.
## Comment #10


We are on vacation near our home--my family is vaccinated and so we gathered together in an easier place for us to all see each other after 1 1/2 years. We wear masks at stores.

We're not trying to make a statement...there's just some places that want you to wear them and other places don't....it's not a hassle.

...that's my whole family from different states. We didn't coordinate it or discuss it--I just noticed that we all pop them on when we go inside.

Many stores have signs 'please wear a mask' and people ignore it...seems rude to ignore their sign.

But I keep saying this on reddit --I have been unable to understand why anyone is upset about someone else wearing a mask or how this became such a big hairy deal
## Comment #11


my birthday comes about memorial day. parents wanted to come visit (~2 hours away, haven't seen them in over a year) along with my brother and his family. wife and i still want masks worn here when social distancing can't take place (e.g. kids playing in the play house)

parents freak out - claim that my niece (12) will be scared that we must have the plague here because we wear masks. rant repeatedly that, "at some point you gotta live your life". seriously - it's a mask, what harm can possibly come from wearing a damn mask?

in the end, i cancelled my birthday. over a year without seeing my family and their stupid level of discontent over masks forced me to pick between insane drama or cancelling the whole thing. :(

## Comment #16


What’s crazy is that the main reason we’ll have to continue to wear masks longer than we should is that about 20% of the population outright refuses to get vaccinated or wear masks.

And it’s those same people who have the gall to be mad at you, when it’s their fault! Lol.
## Comment #17


I just had an issue where my own mother was pressing my husband about wearing a mask. She was so worked up about him being in HER home with a mask on. We didn't make her wear one, we just asked if she would consider it seeing as we weren't comfortable yet/this was our first get together out of quarantine.

"How are you processing all of the news saying that case numbers are better and it's finally over?"

"Why the mask, still? Aren't you vaccinated?"

"What makes you so anxious about it? We're fine."


It was incredibly frustrating. It's a personal decision and shouldn't be a weird sticking point/hot topic of conversation.
## Comment #18


I promise I won't be. I also promise you won't find me wearing a mask anywhere they're not strictly required (most places now, and growing by the day).

I won't be getting in someone's face for still wearing a mask, or even giving them the stink eye or other body language, for the same reason that I will never for a moment entertain wearing one in a place where it's optional because it might make others feel more safe. "Live and let live" cuts both ways (which is a good thing).
## Comment #19


It goes the other way too. Please don’t be a jerk to anyone who no longer wants to wear a mask. Many of us are vaccinated and ready to get on with our lives.
## Comment #20


I don't know where you guys live or are, but I have not seen this behavior, not even once since the mask mandate went away.

I get the feeling some of these posts are a bit hypothetical to allow for a soapbox to stand on.
## Comment #21


There is seriously nothing more frustrating than an un-vaxxed individual getting enraged that some of us who are vaxxed still wear them sometimes. I’ve yet to encounter a masked person bitching at an un-masked one, but the non-maskers seem to LOVE being dicks in public. And the best part is it SHOULD be the other way around.
## Comment #22


 Oh my gosh your story scares me a bit! I've been living in the UK for the entirity of the pandemic and we're all wearing masks, except outside. The delta variant is still a very real threat here and all us under 30s are still waiting for our vaccines.

 But I'm travelling back to MA next week with only 1 vaccine done, I can't imagine not wearing a mask indoors. I'm still surprised the mask order has even been lifted.

 I'm glad things have improved but it all sounds like another world over there. Really think I'm going to struggle to unmask..
## Comment #23


People SHOULD be wearing them if they aren’t vaccinated- how would they know whether or not this applies to you?  

People need to chill.
## Comment #24


It goes more the other way, tbh.  Masks have been mainstream accepted in MA for a year now. The people exercising their choice to now not wear a mask are the ones going out on a limb.
## Comment #25

I went to the market yesterday. Most wearing masks. I started to but realized fuck that, if I'm not required at this point, I'm not wearing it. The world needs to see my beautiful face. I actually appreciate most people keeping it on their ugly mugs. jk..glad we made it..so far.

I have the sniffles this week. I've been fully vaccinated so its \_\_probably\_\_ just the pollen, but I'm going to wear a mask regardless. I also have days where I don't want to shave my face.

## Comment #29


Thank you for your statement, although the DRP (Dumb as Rocks People) here in MA, a) aren't smart enough to find Reddit or know what a sub is and b) use rigid, black and white thinking to compensate for their cognitive challenges. I know I should be a brainstorming problem solver idea generator - this would make me a better person - but indulging my frustrations feels good, especially in such good company.

I remember at the start of the pandemic, I went into Home Depot in Rockland and their floor easel said, "Stay Socially Distanced by keeping 5 feet apart." Yes, yes I did go out to my car and retrieve a Sharpie to cross out the number 5 and enter the number 6. And did you notice how difficult it was for so many people to think in more than one dimension? Socially distancing is not in a straight line folks.

The normalization of masks thrills me. I've always been a knuckles, elbows, knees and feet kinda gal in elevators and public restrooms. I've been confused by the installation of touchless soap dispensers, motion reactive faucets and paper towel dispensers and air hand dryers. Why you might ask? On the the one hand you have a touches soap dispenser to prevent spreading hand nasties, and on the other you have to grab the door handle to exit (And yes, if there are paper towels I use one to open the door and if not, toilet paper will do.).  And air dryers just blow billows of germs everywhere.

The pandemic allowed us (Well, some of us) to change our behaviors and recalibrated how we take care of ourselves. I will always wear a mask inside of supermarkets and the like. I use a glove when getting gas (Heck, the Europeans have been offering gloves at fast stations for decades.), I wash my hands more often and don't feel badly for hightailing it away from coughers and sneezers. I won't go back to the gym. Even though I am very healthy, I caught countless colds at the gym, in spite of hand washing, not touching the rails on the stairmaster, diligent spraying and strategic towel placements.

Some people say I am "OCD" but I don't have the delusional, corresponding beliefs to go with what I see as the logical steps towards prevention. Getting a cold is annoying but not a disaster (unlike Covid of course). They slow me down, so, why get thrown off the rails when you can wear a mask?  I used to bristle when people put their toes to my heels in a line, as if that was going to make things go faster. Now I feel less like an antagonistic, thorny individual when I ask, "Would you mind backing off?"
## Comment #30


Vaccinated people wearing masks will always humor me
## Comment #31


I'm probably still gonna like to wear a mask as a new thing in crowded public places. I like a few things about it. The anonymity, not having to wear makeup, the idea of never catching even a cold again. I'm good with that.

So I play these scenarios out all the time.

"I don't like to be recognized in public"

"Because people recognize me if I don't have it on"

"Because I'm in between dentist appointments and I scare people"

"My mouth is infected" (add whatever voice you want)

Respond in French
## Comment #32


It was not that long ago that redditors we're praised for berating those who didn't wear masks. I think it's coming full circle now.

Not saying I agree w/ it, but I can understand why it's happening.
## Comment #33


I work in a restaurant where I am still forced to wear a mask, despite being vaccinated, because we’re trying to “eer on the side of caution” but it’s really just to be sensitive and patient with the vaccinated maskers.

I cannot do it for one more day. Every where else I get to live life normally, be happy and hopeful again. When I walk into work and everyone’s masked for no reason, I put on the mask for no reason, then when I point out it’s for no reason I am told “it’s policy, it’s to protect us and those around us.”

I contacted corporate management.

I was treated with disgust by one coworker and one manager, they didn’t want to be associated with my anti mask sentiments. They told me they didn’t appreciate me implying people didn’t want to wear it. They could be included. They didn’t want their name connected with my actions.

Every other coworker I had slowly lifted their nose outs. Some pulled it down.

Until we all have a choice, I will shame you, with science, the same way you loved shaming others.
## Comment #34


The masks don’t really accomplish much unless everyone is wearing one, keeping the particulates from asymptomatic carriers inside said carriers noses and mouths. You can do whatever you want, but I feel like keeping a reasonable distance from others and maybe keeping a bottle of hand sanitizer in your pocket and avoiding touching your face will accomplish just about everything that wearing a paper mask does.
## Comment #35


I'm not going out don't call me thanks.
## Comment #36


I mean, he asked if you were a nurse and this is him being mad you had a mask on? He looked angry checking into a hotel? Maybe it’s not all about you and he just got his balls busted on the drive there by his kids and him being mad wasn’t all you?!
How did the lady calm him down? Was she referencing your mask?
I don’t know, sounds like missing info because asking someone if they’re a nurse doesn’t mean they’re mad you’re wearing a mask?

A good read for people who are still wondering why it's important to continue to take precautions.
# New England starting to separate themselves from the rest in terms of vaccinations

I wouldn’t even say it’s 100% a political thing. Yes, NE is known for being very liberal, but I come from a very conservative Catholic (massachusetts) family. We all got vaccinated the second we were able to, and didn’t hesitate over it. I do think that it is a lot to do with being educated, because while most of my family falls into the republican/trump voting sect, a lot of them are or were healthcare workers who pay attention and trust science

Man, I love living around smart people.

Went to a Woo Sox game and an organization is set up in the stadium giving free one shot vaccines out. Free tickets if you get the vaccine. You can get vaccinated on a whim in Massachusetts. That has to help.

Education, access, politics, peer pressure, leadership. A virtuous cycle in this case.

Interesting that NH is falling behind after being way ahead at one point.

Would be interested in hearing people's theories about why this is the case. Yes, we are blue states, but NH isn't really all that blue and they led the charge for a long time in vaccinations. Was it the initial horrible outbreak that instilled enough respect into the population? Or is it the fact that we are such a nexus for medical technology that we trust it more?

I think other than a higher prevalence of higher education, we in New England were impacted much more. Everyone I interact with has had a serious COVID case either within or once removed from their social circle.  We were the reason the rest of the country shut down before they even saw many cases last year.

With that I think we were less susceptible to the COVID politics and just thought about the health risks because we know they are real. A portion of my family is quite red and they all got vaxed at the earliest possible chance. I think the other places still think its a hoax by the dems to steal the office and make trump look bad so its not on the top of their list to line up and get a chip in their arm for the dems to track them.

New Hampshire specifically if they were to be a political outlier in a lot of places depends on tourism and they went from nearly zero cases to vast amounts of cases every time they "opened their borders" so they see the rest of us New Englanders as a threat plus they also probably see it as an economic necessity. They also have a lower population density with less children so more of their population is eligible which skews the numbers a little. Still I think its mostly the former of us all being aware that its a real threat.

Mississippi, u good bro?
## Comment #9


It’s disappointing that it’s clearly becoming a political issue. I feel bad for those living in states with low vaccinate rates who see this for the threat this is.

I hope this also makes us more aware that we very much are living in a bubble in New England.

Really thankful to not live in GA anymore, Jesus christ.

Can we secede and be called New England? Fuck the red neck, southern, ignorant mouth breathers.
## Comment #12


And there is NH... stubbornly being dragged into the future... whether they like it or not.

I think it’s also worth noting that the New England states are tiny and there are fewer *very* rural areas. Most of the population are in just a few places (Boston, Hartford, Portland, Manchester, Burlington). You can literally get from one end of NE to the other in just a few hours and vaccine distribution is easier because of that.
