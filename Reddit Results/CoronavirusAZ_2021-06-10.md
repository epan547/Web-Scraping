## Comment #1


Hello, I'm looking for a specific piece of information.

Trend in COVID cases for children.

I have an unvaccinated 5 year old. I have some understanding that Arizona's daily cases are mostly the unvaccinated? And that in some situations, it is like the unvaccinated are experiencing a spike in infections. But since the children are unvaccinated, I don't know if they are having rising cases.

Meh. Let’s let them slide on this. They really stepped up during covid. Plus, the expired vaccine is still probably good enough.

Great to see we are over 6M doses of the vaccine statewide! We still have a ways to go, but honestly the vaccination rate is so much higher than I would have imagined we’d get here

My oldest (13) got his second shot Friday. Minor side effects for him luckily (very sore arm, slight chills on Saturday, a headache Saturday night that may or may not have been related). Thankful he didn't go full tilt side effects like I did. XD
## Comment #2


**Report for First week of June (6/7)**

**Data Analysis:** The good news is there were high vax numbers posted on Monday, May 31 (17K first dose and 52K second dose). The bad news is, the numbers the next day, and since then, have settled at new lows. For persepective, May 1-30, twenty-five of the thirty days had the rolling average between 12K-15K, so that was a steady plateau. But for the last 5 days, the rolling average has settled at 9K, and that's even inflated by May 31st numbers, which will fall off today and make our rolling average more like 8K. On the upside, I calculate that our actual rate of immunity is around 62%, which is really comforting.... that makes a world of difference.

**DATA**

**New 1st doses reported yesterday: 	7,772**

**New completed vaccinations reported yesterday: 	13,630**

**7-day rolling average for 1st doses: 	9,335**

**7-day rolling average for completed vaccinations: 	15,815**

\----------------------

**For percent vaccinated with 1st dose:  	47.09%**

Single dose projections: 	50% in Late-June, 55% in Early August.

**For percent fully vaccinated: 	40.12%**

Fully vaxxed projections: 	45% Late June

**Estimate of overall immunity:	62.64%**

Check out the 4th tab of my spreadsheet for an explanation.

\----------------------

**Age Groups**

**Each group grows daily by about .1%, except the youngest group which grows at .2% daily.**

15-34: 	37.8%

35-44: 	48.6%

45-54: 	54.6%

55-64: 	66.7%

65+: 	84.7%

Lots of movement in the old case numbers, with a net 94 "new" positives added (or \~150, if you ignore the negative adjustments), most during the 11/15-12/27 period (89), and mid-single digit adjustments all over the place to fill out the rest of that total.
