## Comment #1


I had COVID in February. I got my Moderna Vaccine in April and May, and have been fully vaccinated for two weeks. I wear my mask at work and in stores, only taking them off at restaurants and at other's homes. However, I had it off the whole time at a funeral/reception last Wednesday, where others had theirs off too. 

This afternoon, these symptoms started developing:

- Dry throat (but going away now)

- Stuffy nose (common because I have allergies)

- Very drippy nose (Again, common cuz allergies)

- Can't taste, which I expect from allergies, but I also can't smell, which is what's throwing me off, because I could taste and smell just fine approx 4.5 hours ago. 

Are these signs of a second COVID infection? Because if I have to miss 2 more weeks of work I'm gonna be so fucking mad.
## Comment #2


Pretty minor, but I’ve had a very slight stomach discomfort the past 2 days or so. Friday (6/4) I drank a lot and got drunk lol and ate some junk food, woke up hungover but I noticed my stools were loose. Wasn’t that urgent diarrhea feeling, just looked off.

Felt better as the day went on, but stomach just felt a slight bit off. Had a couple more beers last night.

Woke up this morning feeling fine, but had another bit of loose stools in the morning. Again, wasn’t that urgent diarrhea thing. I’m wondering if it’s just because of the diet these past couple days. Very minor but I’m worried seeing people talk about diarrhea as a symptom. Will not drink at all today and just take it easy, will see how that goes.

For anyone who lost their sense of smell what did it feel like? Was it gradual or did it happen suddenly? Did you feel like you had a headcold? I had a blocked nose yesterday and today my sinuses feel weird and I've a strange smell in my right nostril, the one that's blocked
## Comment #5


Had my first round of Pfizer vaccine 2 weeks ago.  


 Last night I went to bed feeling fine. Woke up at exactly 4 am with an extremely sore throat and redness in the back of my mouth. The pain is still here and it's a struggle to swallow properly.  


 I am feeling very woozy like I am on a boat. I have motion sickness and the feeling is exactly the same, dizziness and unsteady walking. Feeling hot and cold, but no fever. Taste and smell are here, although my nose is a bit stuffed.   


 How common is sore throat as a first symptom?
## Comment #6


I completed my Pfizer vaccine schedule in April. Here has been my experience since last Friday:

Day 1 (Friday): tickling dry cough in my throat & lungs.

Day 2 (Saturday): continued cough, sore throat, a coughing spell so intense I almost vomited.

Day 3 (Sunday): continued cough, sore throat, body beginning to run a low fever (>=99), another couple of intense coughing spells that had me gagging. Restless legs and insomnia.

Day 4 (Monday): sick. coughing, throat is killing me, fever hitting 100, headache, body aches, another couple of intense coughing spells, sinuses burning, eyes burning. I get a covid test. Restless legs and insomnia.

Day 5 (Tuesday): very sick. coughing, throat is killing me, fever hits 101.5, headache, body aches, my back/chest/stomach muscles hurt so much from coughing, I dread it; sinuses still burning, eyes burning. Covid test comes back negative. Evening: fever spikes to 103.5, smell and taste are completely gone; urgent care confirms my fever, does a chest x-ray which is clean; conclusion is an upper respiratory virus. Terrible restless legs and insomnia; I'm up virtually all night.

Day 6 (today): feel much better, but still sick. Smell and taste are still gone. Lightheaded and lethargic, but pain is less. Sore throat, burning sinuses, 

Seems crazy if it's not Covid, and I plan to get another test tomorrow. Four other vaccinated people in my household are still perfectly healthy, and my youngest son (10yo) who was not vaccinated developed the same dry cough for a couple of days.
## Comment #7


Currently experiencing all the symptoms except loss of taste/smell. PCR test taken yesterday and instant test taken today came back negative. Am I in the clear or should I test again in a day or two.
?
## Comment #8


I’ve always been having difficulty breathing throughout my life but very recently it’s been worse. By a little bit 🤔. And it comes and goes
## Comment #9


First time posting, but I’m on vacation and I woke up Tuesday morning not being able to taste or smell anything... by taste I mean I can’t taste flavor... I can sense a slight sweetness, saltiness, spicy, but absolutely zero flavor... as for smell? 100% can’t smell anything at all... not even a freshly open bag of coffee with a full deep inhale...

In addition to loss of taste and smell I have a sore throat, slight cough and red striations and whiteness on the back of my throat... I felt woozy on Monday a little bit and on Tuesday I also had a slight fever of 100.5

I’m currently sitting in an urgent care waiting to get tested... Walgreens and CVS, where it would be free, doesn’t have any appointments available where I’m vacationing...
# I’m so frustrated.

Going to make this as short as possible. I had covid almost 4 months ago and it sucked. I never fully recovered but I was getting there and getting much better 
Fast foward to now and I’ve been exposed to two positives in the last 2 weeks, started feeling awful again couldn’t breathe and I tested positive again. My blood results show NO anti bodies too which means nothing to fight them off hence why I got it abain.

My rant is though when I tell people I’m very sick again was in contact with two positives and I tested positive again. They tell me im still positive from the first time. It sucks. Im so sick and I’ve got people telling me it’s a fake positive. At the end of the day it doesn’t really matter because I know what’s up and it’s a real positive also based off doctors advice but I just need to know how to handle it when people tell me it’s positive from my first time without wanting to scream. Ok end of rant thank you 😂

## Comment #1


you might want to [look](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33800489/) at this research article about the different antibody test and maybe get retested for the antibody...its likely you may have been infected with a mutated strain. 

not medical advise.
## Comment #2


I'm so sorry you're sick again... and yeah, your situation sounds VERY frustrating.  

I think some people just don't want to hear the truth about reinfection.  They want to be cheerful and la-la-la.  I mean, you see this on the covid news forums on reddit.  Someone will come in with a 'check' to some bit of positive news and the response is frequently a lot of anger.

Are you considering getting vaccinated?  

Also, wishing you a speedy recovery.
## Comment #3


Hope you feel better soon
## Comment #4


"you can believe anything you want. It's not worth my energy/my job/intention to convince you either way" or something to that effect.
## Comment #5


Stop being around people that are sick and wear a mask

Get well soon. Sorry to hear that.
## Comment #8


Are you able to get the Ct value for your new positive test? If the Ct value is low, that means the amount of virus is high, which really is only possible with a reinfection. Then you can shut those people up :)
## Comment #9


So overall is it as bad as the first time ?
## Comment #10


I’m sorry you have to go through it again. It’s my worst fear if I’m being honest. Covid in January really fucked up my right ear. Have had pain, inflammation and tinnitus since. I work in a hospital and although cases here where I live are really low, I’m still so paranoid.
I hope you feel better soon!
## Comment #11


So sorry to hear. Have you considered getting the vaccine?
# I’m on day 7. I have only been able to sleep in very short increments. How do I get more sleep?


Created: 2021-06-10 12:02:51

I’m finding it incredibly frustrating, I’m very tired and constantly find myself drifting off, only to wake up 10-20 mins later. What’s worse it literally feels like I’ve just closed and opened my eyes. Getting some pharmacy prescribed sleeping tablets helped a little bit in that I spent the best part of 8 hours doing this 10-20 minute naps, but I feel like i get no rest out of them at all. I also often experience very vivid images and can sometimes see them before I’ve even “feel asleep”. 

Has anyone heard of anything similar or have any tips to get sleep? It’s absolutely driving me insane.

## Comment #1


I actually feel the same but for me, I'm getting 1.5-2 hours of sleep.

Doctor has advised melatonin for now, I think there was a day wherein I had a 3-hour sleep (but, back to the aforementioned periods again).

I had the opposite problem. A fees where all I wanted to do was sleep, or at least chill and not work/adult.
## Comment #4


It's probably due to your high heart rate. Rest. Relax. Take melatonin

I felt that it was easier to sleep in upright in a comfy recliner.
# My mom tested positive


Created: 2021-06-09 13:10:46

She always had her nose hanging out of her mask no matter how much I scolded her, and now I have to go get tested tomorrow…I’m immunosuppressed…

Edit: I live in AFRICA….for those of you saying that I’m stupid for not being vaccinated, I don’t have a choice.

https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/nvvl7v/my_mom_tested_positive/
## Comment #1


I noticed that this pandemic taught people that didn't know how to wear a mask, nothing!  There's a proper way doffing and donning PPE. Forward it to her
## Comment #2


Now we are all worried about you!!! I have a friend who is the same and cannot get the vaccine and it is very worrisome for him. 

Keep us posted on how you are doing please.
## Comment #3


Wow, I'm sorry. Yeah, stay away from her. If you show up negative , and you live with your mom, I suggest you see if you can stay somewhere else until she is no longer contagious. Covid is not fun. Avoid your mom as much as you can until she tests negative twice.
## Comment #4


Was your mom vaccinated? What a bummer, sorry to hear.
## Comment #5


Make sure you are now isolated from your mom.  Covid is not fun.  My family did everything we were supposed to do.  My husband and I are essential workers and my son got it from daycare and gave it to my husband and I.
## Comment #6


Make sure you avoid those rapid antibody tests as they're not that accurate, get tested with the PCR test.
## Comment #7


If you are positive, being immunosupressed, makes you eligible for the antibody treatment from Regeneron or Lili.  But it must be given within the first 10 days of infection.
## Comment #8


Wishing you good health, no covid, and the best.  

I hope you continue to wear your mask around her and anyone she hangs around so you can stay safe.
## Comment #9


I feel you OP, I would get so upset seeing people do this, even the director at my job would walk around like this and pull it all the way down when he would talk.  I hope you recover quickly.
## Comment #10


Stay far away from her!
## Comment #11


I can’t stand it when people don’t have their noses covered. The nose is the most dangerous place for covid to enter!!!

I hope your mom’s case is mild and that you test negative. I have lupus and survived moderate covid at home. It SUCKED but it I made it through. All the best to you.
## Comment #12


how irresponsible of her, i hope she feels guilty at least. wishing both of you all the best, hopefully you didn’t catch it.
## Comment #13


First of all, masks don’t protect you, they actually protect others. (Besides the n95 which is reserved for healthcare workers) Second I’m sorry that you’re Immunocompromised! I hope that if you do catch it, that it’s extremely mild 💕 Also I’ve read a very recent study that says once she has caught it, it’s as effective or even more so than the vaccine, so that’s great news for you and your mother! I would avoid her for about two weeks.
## Comment #14


There is almost no one in the United States who should be un-vaccinated. The ONLY people who can't be vaccinated are those who have had an anaphylactic reaction to their first shot.   All 12 of you, please don't get your second shot.

Also anyone anaphylacticaly allergic to polyethylene glycol. "Polyethylene glycol compounds are widespread in household products from skin care and cosmetics, to baby wipes and cleaners. They are used as thickeners, softeners, moisture-carrying agents, penetration enhancers, and surfactants."  -And also as constipation treatments.   27 cases in the last 40 years of allergies.

 There is almost no one who shouldn't get this vaccine. There are at most 50-60 people in the US who shouldn't get this vaccine, and yet I had at least 20 patients today who said they won't get the vaccine. Why?????    They could stop wearing a mask?. They would stop being susceptible to a virus that could kill or bankrupt them. I have no idea. Ignorance.

## Comment #16


Are either of you vaccinated? I think you need to add a little bit more to your story.
## Comment #17


Even if you are immunosuppressed you should get the vaccine. You are in the US and are able to get a free vaccine. [https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/immunocompromised-patients-covid-19-vaccines](https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/immunocompromised-patients-covid-19-vaccines)

Everyone in the world should get the vaccine as soon as it is available.  There are millions of people not able to get the vaccine and you are making a mockery of their suffering. Americans are a unique form of Stupid and you are among them.
## Comment #18


Mask will stop many droplets on a cough or sneeze, but it will pass microscopic airborne virus that has been identified as the primary means of spreading the infection.  


And if you research it, most 3rd world countries do not have ready access to vaccines for whatever they are worth, but highly effective and usually inexpensive therapeutics are available. Ivermectin seems to be at the top of safe and effective medications.

# I tested Positive in Colombia for covid before my flight back to America today. What should I do next


Created: 2021-06-10 06:04:34

hello. I just found out that I tested positive for Covid 19 today before my flight tomorrow. I feel no symptoms and was shocked when I seen the results. 

my flight back to America was suppose in the morning and now I'm stuck wondering. what should I do?

I've been trying to find articles or rules that explain this situation in context. 

Does anyone know how many days I have to self quarantine? I seen articles ranging from 10 days to 14 days but I havent found anything official.

my biggest concern is the cost of staying here for x amount of days. is there something that helps people in these type of situations when it comes to being able to quarantine at affordable prices. 

the crazy thing about it is I got the first dose of my vaccine last week before coming here and never knew you can still catch covid. this situation sucks but I need help from fellow redditors on what i should do next?

I'm down to take another test again to see maybe if this is a false positive. but I dont know If when you get a positive covid test, that means you automatically have to quarantine for x amount of days. 

I'm in Cartagena by the way. Please help. Thank you.

## Comment #1


It’s 14 days from the time you test positive in Colombia (just asked my aunt, who is a surgeon). So, hunker down and wait it out. Colombia doesn’t need any more devastation from the virus than it’s already had.

But just a heads up that you can continue shedding the virus for several months even though you’re no longer contagious, which means you can be stuck at your destination indefinitely because you’ll keep testing positive. Happened to several contacts of mine over recent months, and it truly sucked for them. That’s why I personally would only travel internationally to places where I’m okay taking the risk of being stuck indefinitely.
## Comment #2


14 Days, clear to travel once you have a negative test result. 

That's why you don't travel unless absolutely necessary during these times.

# I don't know what kind of cough I have


Created: 2021-06-10 15:21:04

I'm very very ignorant about this cough topic. I don't know if my cough is dry or wet. When I cough, nothing really comes "out of my mouth", but some wet stuff does come to my "throat"/neck area. It doesn't come into my mouth (where my tongue is) unless I force it out after it comes to my throat.

And that thing that comes to my throat, if I force it out, looks like just saliva. I don't feel it coming from my chest or lungs. I feel more like its coming from deeper inside my throat, not deep down from the lungs. But Im not sure. Maybe Im not supposed to "feel it coming up from the lungs"?

I do feel a "tickle" feeling in my throat, which is why I cough. To get rid of the tickle, but this does bring some slimy saliva-like stuff to my throat. Maybe it is just saliva? It definitely looks like saliva when I force it out of my throat to out of my mouth. How am I forcing it out? I make a Khkhkhkh sound in my throat.  I definitely don't see a disgusting "phelm" thing, unless that saliva-like thing is phelm. 

So what type of cough is it that I have? 

I've tried cough syrup "for dry cough" for days, but it hasn't helped a single bit. Should I try the cough syrup for wet cough? I'm just not sure what kind of cough it is that I have.

# Need support of survivors! My 40 year old cousin is currently intubated :(


Created: 2021-06-09 22:45:59

I need to hear covid survivors stories... I’m terrified for my cousin. He doesn’t have any comorbidities or health issues. Idk what happened... he had mild symptoms but suddenly they got worse and worse. After two days of struggling in ER (He was literally sitting in a plastic chair for two days with an oxygen tank), the hospital finally assigned him a bed and intubated him. He has Pneumonia and lung infection. The doctors are positive with his case due to his age and health history. However, we’re very scared. I need support, stories of success... anything.
Thank you

There are many people who have been intubated and lived to tell the tale. The chances are good for your cousin considering his age and health history. Praying for him 💕

OP, I'm a severe Covid survivor; I was intubated for 7 weeks & a year later, I'm mostly fine.  There are other survivors in r/CovidICU, if you want to cross-post.

Meanwhile, please feel free to DM me. I'll be praying for your cousin!

agreed. I have huge anxiety and anytime I get like a throat issue or some type of allergy symptom I jump thinking it’s COVID when my city has dipped in cases. I come here and it’s like everyone gets infected or reinfected even vaccinated so it makes me question whether or not the US are cappin lol I’m from NYC and it’s decreased a lot over here. I had it back in March and got fully vaccinated in April
## Comment #3


agreed.  further, even in the USA, we are getting roughly 100,000 new illegals here every month.  i submit they should not only have rcovid-related documentation from the US, but they should also have sub-identification showing their country of origin.

About 3 months ago I had to self isolate for 2 weeks cause my mam and dad tested positive, I did 3 tests all negative 3 days between. Now again today my sister has tested positive and I'm really I'll like chesty cough, lathargy and just sleeping alot. I've done 2 tests one yesterday and another today and all still negative. Even when my freinds got it last October who I hung round with all the time I still test negative. I've tried researching this as it seems like abit of a coincidence but haven't found anyone with a similar experience. Anyone else experienced this?
