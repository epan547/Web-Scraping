## Comment #1


Does anyone know if there's data that the lottery announcement made first time vaccines go up in the following days?

Our lottery offerings seem so small compared to most states and I wonder if they'll actually work to push people off the fence in the same way letting the vaccinated ditch masks did.
## Comment #2


According to the NY Times charts, as of 6/3, the daily average case rate in WA is 10/100k, twice the national average! But our vaccination rate is well above the national average. Covid restrictions are greater than many other states. Can anyone explain?

## Comment #1


They did a good job bringing the vaccine to schools right away. They were up and ready as soon as 12 and up was announced.
## Comment #2


WTG west coast, six out of the top 8!
## Comment #3


Wish Snohomish county could get in line with this.
## Comment #4


Do you think that it is a coincidence this happened in the [most educated city](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-23/ranking-america-s-most-educated-cities) in the US?
## Comment #5


This is great news!!! 78% with at least 1 dose too 🙌
## Comment #6


The rest of the state should take notice.  King County is DONE with the virus and mitigations.  If areas like Spokane keep turning into a fire of virus spread--F 'em... they will get no support from the rest of us in the vaccinated, civilized world.  The fact is Washington has beaten the virus and only the antivaxxers left will be the ones left to suffer.  Good riddance.  We will not hold up our recovery for these cretins.

woooooo lessss goooo!!!🙌

less gooo 🙌🏼🙌🏼
## Comment #9


Fuck yeah!!!! ...I mean we were first to report the virus so.... Makes sense. (Maybe not the first cases but the first to notice in the news)
## Comment #10


Wtg Seattle.
## Comment #11


fuuuck. We're 1st?
## Comment #12


Good for ya'll. Are we done, now? Can we go back to not being scared of everything?
## Comment #13


You would never know looking at your local QFC where 95% of the people in there were still wearing a mask as of Monday. At least the gym I went to looked a little more reflective of the vaccination rate- most were without a mask (although some still used the treadmill with a mask. I don’t know how they can do that).

ETA: and the thumbs down proves my point. People here in Seattle aren’t letting go of masks even though they are vaccinated.
## Comment #14


Top 8 what?
## Comment #15


Does this mean we get to drop restrictions early? Or was that when the whole state gets to 70%?
## Comment #16


This is great, but has anyone noticed how our case rates are still high compared to many other parts of the country?
## Comment #17


Wonder what’s going to happen to all of them in a few months, or later on in their lifetime.
## Comment #18


Awesome! So since the pandemics over we are going to address the massive urban campgrounds! 

Or is it time to just give up?
## Comment #19


Congratulations its official Seattle has the most Pussy's in the USA.  All vaccined chipped and taxed.
## Comment #20


Well good! Gotta win at something!  We're winning at highest case rates in the country.
# 66% of 16+ in WA have been partially vaccinated.

## Comment #1


The number is actually much higher (70%+), but the DOH thinks the several hundred thousand people who live here who were vaccinated by the federal government don't count.
## Comment #2


CDC says we are over 70% for 18+, so they are saying 16-17 year olds make up much more than 4% of our population?

Edit:
According to DOH 42.7% of 16-17 year olds have initiated vaccination.

rural health systems cannot survive without the cities backing them up.  the redneck plague is gonna stink.
## Comment #5


Prediction: June 20th will either be the day that we reach 70%, and we open on the 21st. Or June 20th will be the day that we open up.
## Comment #6

# Washington state - 403 new cases - 406,802 cases total - 6/8/2021 Case Updates


Created: 2021-06-10 00:20:29

*NOTE: I am only reporting confirmed PCR test cases. Look at my* [Google docs spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m4Uxht9mn3BlMu5zq7EB5Ud05GhMLwawvuZuNqXg8vg) *or the* [DOH data dashboard](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/DataDashboard) *to see the probable numbers (which include unconfirmed antigen test results).*

*NOTE: I've had a number of people reach out to me asking how to show thanks for these posts. I always appreciate Reddit gold, but if you want to do something more substantive please make a donation to the PB&J scholarship fund, intended to help kids who are late bloomers.* [*https://pbjscholarship.org/*](https://pbjscholarship.org/)

The 403 new cases on 6/8 are lower than the 479 new cases on 6/7 on a higher volume of tests (14,741 total tests on 6/8 vs 10,995 total tests on 6/7).

The eight new deaths on 6/8 are close to the average seven new deaths on 6/4, 6/5 and 6/6. The -71 new deaths on 6/7 aren't useful for comparison since that was a data dump to correct previous over-counts.

The 54 new hospitalizations on 6/8 are lower than the 84 new hospitalizations on 6/7.

The 23,864 average new vaccine doses on 6/7 and 6/8 are lower than the 40,175 average new vaccine doses on 6/4, 6/5 and 6/6.

The department of health says the negative results still aren't being fully accounted for so we have to use caution in drawing conclusions.

According to the DOH web site:

>***Wednesday, June 9, 2021:*** *Negative test results data from November 21–30, 2020, are incomplete. Thus, negative test results and percent positivity (Testing tab) for that period should be interpreted with caution. Otherwise, the incomplete time frames presented in the dashboard are correct and up to date. The Epidemiologic Curves tab is the most accurate representation of COVID activity and is updated daily as new cases are identified.* 

As always let's all wear masks when around others and take vitamin D (even when vaccinated!).

* NOTE: These are newly reported cases, not "yesterday's cases". This often includes data going back a few days. Use the dashboard below, to get the best picture for how a particular city is doing.

The 152 "new since yesterday" cases are more than the 78 from last week. However, 80 of those cases were for dates earlier than June 1, so it looks like the county is once again adding some older backfill data. I do have some bad news, however. For the first time in weeks, I am seeing daily cases that are week-over-week *increases*. For example, there were 69 cases for Monday (6/7). But the previous Monday (5/31) had only 51 cases. Maybe this was just due to Memorial Day, and fewer people getting tested? Granted, it's not a large increase, but I think it's a sign that we are starting to hit our plateau state. I'm doubtful we're going to hit a daily average of 50 by next week. Maybe by end of the month, if at all?

A few weeks ago, the Washington Post posted an interesting article that looked at [COVID risk just for unvaccinated people](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/interactive/2021/covid-rates-unvaccinated-people/). What they did was take positive case numbers, assumed everyone who was getting infected was unvaccinated (which is a reasonable assumption, given the efficacy of the vaccines), used vaccination and population data to estimate the unvaccinated population, and finally calculated what the COVID case rate would be for these folks. I replicated the methodology for King County [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQDkUPrVwNh5kZi4IaWUDzu6awrt4s1OY0CiGFuG9XzOeMGOwrLxdUVnIRtPTus7qZNTGgIX0nodmQm/pubchart?oid=487642312&format=interactive). The results are a bit alarming. As you can see, our county-wide 7-day rolling average, when adjusted for population, is just under 4. Not bad! It's below the US average (5), and one of the lower points that we've seen during the entire pandemic. But if assume that pretty much all cases are happening just to the unvaccinated population, then their 7-day avg case rate (per 100K) is much higher! Recently it's been around 10-12, and it was much, much higher earlier in the month. That's actually pretty scary. The COVID case rate for unvaccinated individuals is two to three times higher than what it looks like for county at large.

In short, anti-vaxxers might *think* things are relatively peachy for them, but they would be mistaken. While the COVID case rate for unvaccinated residents has dropped a bunch, I still wouldn't call it "low". Maybe I should do a COVID chance metric for unvaccinated residents? Or better yet, these unvaccinated residents should just get the freaking jab if they're eligible!

As always, please stay healthy and safe! Get vaccinated as soon as you can, so we can finally put an end to the pandemic!

## Comment #5


* I'm adopting the new naming scheme in use by the WHO. Definitions have been updated at least once in the body of this post and all listed again at the end of this post.

* Total sequencing numbers in the weekly DoH report are only of cases with a known home county. **18 %** of sequences from WA state are not assigned to a county and are excluded from the summary report. This is up from 16% fits with the 1000+ Unassigned case counts that were added last week due to backfill (see my post from Monday for details).

* Per this week's report: Over **17.5 %** of confirmed positive cases sampled in April were sequenced! This is almost one in five cases sequenced!

* The WHO has named B.1.427/B.1.429 (Epsilon) which is awkward because our state continues to track them separately. However, to simplify my graphs (and because B.1.427 is a nothing burger), I'm summing them so when I write "Epsilon" it is referring to B.1.427 and B.1.429 together.

* The proportion of Epsilon in April has fallen off a cliff while B.1.1.7 (Alpha) continues to dominate as usual.

* B.1.526 (Iota) and B.1.526.1 are grouped together as Iota*. The state report does not include the sublineages B.1.526.2 and B.1.526.3 though after glancing at GISAID they have ticked up in our state. No idea what significance (if any) there is about that.

* P.1 (Gamma) *was* holding steady in April at ~ 10 % of cases sequenced, but this latest batch of data shows that had actually increased in late April and early May, we just didn't see it till now. Expect this to get bigger.

* B.1.617 and all three sublineages B.1.617.1 (Kappa), B.1.617.2 (Delta), and B.1.617.3 are grouped together here as Delta**. [Editorial note: I really, really wish the CDC and DOH would upgrade this to a Variant of Concern]

* Delta** is accelerating. I fully expect next week's report to show the proportion of Delta** in early May will exceed Epsilon. That would mean it has actually already exceeded it because all of our data is lagged by a *minimum* of 10 days, with comprehensive data clocking in at around 4-6 weeks. 

* B.1.351 (Beta), P.2 (Zeta), and B.1.525 (Eta) continue to only have a low amount of spread. Beta's most recent increase is largely backfill from over a month ago.

* Sequencing within WA is not randomized nor representative. I'm trying to make it clearer which graphics show cases added by specimen date (distributed) and which show cases added as a sheer total and not by specimen date (non-distributed totals). If anything seems unclear or is confusing please don't hesitate to ask and I'll do my best to answer.

* Vaccine breakthrough (V.B.) events specific to VoCs are posted here. Overall V.B. stats are in a separate post.

Here's the breakdown of variant ratios across age and known health status from this week's report:

You can compare the differences from first graph to the second graph to get an idea of how much of this report's increase is due to backfill.

Top two ranking counties- King and Snohomish. Over this past weekend the state *unassigned* over 1000 cases from King county and you'll see a reflection of that with at least one of the variant totals being a negative amount.

Copy/Pasting Known Attributes:

**"Alpha" - B.1.1.7** (first identified in the United Kingdom, first Washington state specimen: Jan, 7th 2021)

* Highly infectious, transmissible and can quickly spread from person to person. 
* Based on published studies this variant potentially causes more severe symptoms and increased risk of death in individuals who are infected.

**"Beta" - B.1.351** (first identified in South Africa, first Washington state specimen: Jan, 29th 2021)

* Highly infectious, transmissible and can quickly spread from person to person. 
* Results from experimental research studies show that this variant contains mutations that make it less likely to respond to antibody treatments.

**"Epsilon" - B.1.427 and B.1.429** (first identified in California, first Washington state specimens: Dec, 11th 2020 and Nov, 20th 2020 respectively)

* Can quickly spread from person-to-person. 
* Results from experimental research studies show that this variant contains mutations that make it less likely to respond to antibody treatments.

**"Gamma" - P.1** (first identified in Brazil, first Washington state specimen: Feb, 6th 2021)

* Highly infectious, transmissible and can quickly spread from person-to-person. 
* Results from experimental research studies show this variant contains mutations that make it less likely to respond to antibody treatments.


**"Eta" - B.1.525, "Iota" - B.1.526 and B.1.526.1** (first identified in New York, first Washington state specimens: Feb, 5th 2021 and Jan, 21st 2021 respectively)

**"Zeta" - P.2** (first identified in Brazil, first specimen collected in Washington state: Jan, 28th 2021)

* These variants contain mutations that can make it less responsive to antibody treatments.


**"Delta" - B.1.617.2, "Kappa" - B.1.617.1, B.1.617, and B.1.617.3** (first identified in India, first Washington state specimen: Mar, 22nd 2021) 

* Based on preliminary evidence, some antibody treatments may be less effective. 
* Studies are ongoing to determine whether these variants are more transmissible. [editorial note- the studies have been done in the UK, it overtook Alpha with ease and is now dominant despite local restrictions and increased contact tracing and vaccination efforts, CDC absolutely needs to upgrade this to a VoC]

## Comment #6


Important notes:

* The criteria for identifying vaccine breakthrough cases include a positive lab test (either a PCR test or an antigen test) at least 14 days after a person received their last recommended dose of an authorized COVID-19 vaccine.

* These data are limited to sequences from specimens collected after 1/17/2021, the first week when a vaccine breakthrough case could have been identified according to the above definition.


* Sequencing data/specimens are not taken from representative samples, are taken from confirmed (PCR) positives, and are not proportionate to cases.

* Vaccine breakthrough cases are being prioritized for sequencing.

* Data has a multi-week delay. What is posted is most likely a look at what was happening between late January and early May.

* Unlike the CDC, there is no indication that WA DoH will continue recording confirmed vaccine breakthrough cases even if it doesn't lead to a hospitalization or death.


At a Glance:
https://imgur.com/WfgnKdh

* 1837 vaccine breakthrough cases have been identified (as in met the breakthrough case criteria) in Washington State.

Of the cases that have data available:

* 76 % of cases (with data available) reported symptoms
* 21 % of cases have **no symptom information**
* 10 % of cases (with data available) were hospitalized
* 26 % of cases have **no hospitalization information**
* 31 people died of COVID-related illness (median 86 years).
* 22 % of vaccine breakthrough samples were sequenced.             
* 90 % of sequenced samples were of either Variants of Concern (VoCs) or Interest (VoIs).

Age Group | # of Cases | % of Cases
 ----- | ------ | -----
 0-19 | 16 | 1 %
 20-34 | 316 | 17 %
 35-49 | 467 | 25 %
 50-64 | 441 | 24 %
 65-79 | 388 | 21 %
 80+ | 209 | 11 %
Confirmed Symptomatic | 1105 | 76 %
Confirmed Hospitalized | 135 | 10 %

>The -71 new deaths on 6/7 aren't useful for comparison since that was a data dump to correct previous over-counts.

To manipulate data representation is not a good thing, it just shows what you want to show and not the real thing. - 71 yesterday is what we got, no need to ignore that number.

Everyone going into this care home should be vaccinated. Shame on the people working/visiting who are not.
## Comment #2


TLDR: Covid 19 outbreak at a long term care facility in Clallam County continues to grow among unvaccinated and vaccinated staff and residents. Two residents have been hospitalized in the ICU but are now out; they are still hospitalized but are improving.

For the doubters, here's a recent article that mentions that the two hospitalized residents were vaccinated:

https://www.peninsuladailynews.com/news/clallam-reports-10-more-covid-cases-as-state-vaccination-lottery-begins/

Vaccines are fantastic but aren't perfect. It is important to mention that the LTCF population is exceedingly frail and frequently immunocompromised. In this case, the vaccines worked well: they kept the vulnerable alive.

Will the names be publicly announced? I know it’s enormously unlikely that my name gets picked but when receiving my first shot they told me they’d contact me via email to schedule my second shot and I said “so what if you spell my name wrong when emailing me like everyone always does and I never hear from you” and they were like, well I guess you could call us but that’s not going to happen. Well guess what? After a few weeks went by I hadn’t been contacted and when I finally got them on the phone, oh look they sent an email to an address that had misspelled my name like I anticipated. So is there any way I could check that that isn’t happening here?

# New variant reports


Created: 2021-06-09 22:28:12

My two favorite variant reports are out with new data today.    
First, the national CDC variant data is out [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions), and you can see that P1 is doing pretty well, growing from 4.8% week ended 4/24 to 6.3% week ended 5/8 to 8.1% week ended 5/22. However, overall cases are going down faster than that nationally, so nationally, P1 is growing as a percentage even while the total number of cases is likely dropping.  
Delta, the India variant, B.1.617.2, grew from 0.6% to 1.3% to 2.5%.  The error bars are large on this, but it looks like it's doubling as a percent of total every two weeks.  For comparison, nationally cases went from 7 day average 55,194 to 40,236 to 24904.  So, extrapolating (with wide error bars), that means an estimated 331 cases to 523 cases to 622 cases.  In other words, delta is growing, doubling about every 4 weeks, with wide error bars.  Given increases in vaccination nationally over the past four weeks, nationally delta is likely growing very slow or flat now, but places with low vaccination are likely seeing growth.  


In addition, the Washington state variant report is out, [https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/data-tables/420-316-SequencingAndVariantsReport.pdf](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/data-tables/420-316-SequencingAndVariantsReport.pdf)  
P.1 is up to 13.6% for week ended 5/22, from 9.1% week ended May 8.  That's comparable to the pace at which Washington state is trending down, so overall P.1 is probably roughly constant based on the Washington State dashboard 7 day average epidemiologic curves - both weeks would have about 110 cases of P1, so P1 is basically flat in Washington state.   Elsewhere in that report is the only data I've been able to find on vaccine escapes in WA or elsewhere.  20% of escapes are P1, compared to 7% P1 overall.  P1 does seem a bit scary in that regard. 2% of escapes are Delta, compared to 1% overall, but those numbers are too small to draw any conclusions.  


What do we conclude from all this? Probably that while variants like B.1.1.7 (alpha) continue to shrink, P1 is likely to be roughly flat in WA and Delta is probably slowly growing.  To really get Covid under control in WA state, given these  variants, we need a bunch more vaccinations, but given the current slow and dropping rate of vaccinations, it's not clear how this plays out.

## Comment #1


It plays out by the antivaxxers who screeched and cried about their freedoms or whatever other bullshit dying.

Look in the WA report at the % of people hospitalized by variant type.  P1 and delta are putting sick people in the hospital at least 2x as much as the other variants.

Bottom line--if you don't have a shot, you will eventually get nailed by P1 or delta or whatever worse variant comes after that.  Your hubris will get you killed.  Make it quick and go down without too much of a fight please is my advice--we are sick of the antivaxxers holding us back.
## Comment #2


Delta is bad. The UK variant is like 1.5x more infectious than the original, and Delta is like 2x. It's only a matter of time until it becomes the dominant variant.
