# Is this a tick bite? Megathread

## Comment #1


I had a large tick on me. Pulled it off a little over 24 hours after being in the woods. It was difficult to remove. I pulled very hard. It left a tiny wound that scabbed over. But now there's a red rash a little bigger than a quarter. Yes I've been scratching it a little, but this is in the skin. Not sure if it's a mild infection or lyme. Skin is a little plump but not bad

I'm in Georgia so Lyme unlikely.

Not sure if this is the right place to post this but my llmd says these are bartonella striae, I was curious it anyone else has skin irregularities like this? I have two lines on one arm and one line on the other. https://imgur.com/a/p0DM2KJ/

I know these were tick bites as I was in an uninhabited grassy area 2-3 days ago and only just realised they were ticks today as some were still latched onto my leg. I removed them and they left these bumps. What should i do?

[tick?](https://ibb.co/1r5gtMQ)
It wasn’t original red, I’ve been trying with tweezers. I don’t *think* it’s a tick, but personally, I want to be *sure* it’s not one. I don’t see legs, but it’s definitely small either way. Can’t get it with tweezers, it’s almost like underneath the skin.
## Comment #6


I found a tick on me last night, I dont think it was there for too long but it dug itself in already and was sucking blood. The spot still kinda hurts but Im wondering if that goes away
## Comment #7


I feel like I’m probably just being paranoid but should I be worried about [this weird mark that appeared on my face](https://imgur.com/a/GA3GJhC)? 

The red spot is flat-topped but slightly raised overall and feels a bit rough to the touch. The blanched is what’s making me kind of nervous since I’ve never had a rash where that happens before. Neither area is itchy/painful or flaking/oozing/open wound. 

I don’t have any other symptoms and the rash doesn’t seem to be anywhere else on my body. I couldn’t get a tick bite on my cheek without noticing, right? 

Any ideas what this could be and if I should go to a dermatologist?

Tick bite? We did a cleanup and one participant of 10 found a single tick

Hardly itches. No symptoms

Haven’t been in any wooded areas recently, and have not found any ticks on me or my family. Not sure what else this would be though.
## Comment #10


https://imgur.com/a/vJV4iSs been out golfing. Had a bite and scratched the crap out of it. Now I'm wondering is this a tick bite or did I scratch a regular bug bite too much
## Comment #11


This suddenly appeared few hours ago. It doesn’t itch or anything. I did have headache for last 12 hours. Could it be tick? I did play volleyball yesterday, so hoping this is a bruise from that, but it is rather red for bruise. Thanks!

What do you think? 

https://www.reddit.com/user/dexterrible/comments/noem5i/spiderdex_day_3_kinda_feels_softer_by_touch/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Been to ER right away I noticed it (last Friday), no pain, no fever, nothing I feel great as usual. I check myself for ticks usually when I go hiking, but didn’t notice anything initially this looked like a pimple, and next day or two it was itching so I took a look and to my suprise saw this.

ER suspected a spider bite reaction after examination , gave me a topic cream and told me to keep an eye on it and if it gets worse or I feel fever etc to come back.

So far, so good.

Btw, that same night I visited ER when I came back home very late at around 2 am in the morning I saw a pretty bit spider for Switzerland standards, near my
Bedroom on the ceiling.

Curious about your thoughts! Thanks
Edit, feel free to ask me more questions

Camping at sequoia in California. Saw a red dot at first but came home to this the next day. Itched a bit but not that much. Never saw a tick but looks like a white clearing but not sure if skin color is blocking the bullseye look.
What do you guys think?
# Cacao help Lyme?

## Comment #1


Cacao does nothing for me.  I add it to whey protein shakes for the potassium (up to 5 tablespoons of pure unsweetened cacao powder at a time) and I don’t see any of the effects you’re noting.  Glad it works for you though.
## Comment #2


Thanks for the tip I'll give it a try!
## Comment #3


I wonder if you're getting that effect because Cocoa causes a release of endorphins which in turn reduce pain.
# Tick bite - do I need antibiotics?

## Comment #1


I'm in the UK I had been put walking on Monday afternoon and felt something bite my neck. I swiped at the back of my neck I instinctively and am sure it was a deer tick. I've got an appointment with the doctor tomorrow? I feel okay. No fever etc. Should I be getting antibiotics?
## Comment #2


It’s not unreasonable to take preventive measures. Nobody can tell you definitely what the right move is for your particular situation, but many of us have suffered because we didn’t move swiftly enough after a tick encounter. So it’s up to you to evaluate the risk of inaction vs being overly proactive by trying to get a short course of antibiotics that have few side effects when used properly.
## Comment #3


You actually felt the bite? And you swiped it off immediately?

Are you sure it's a tick? Did you see it clearly?

Tick bites are normally imperceptible and they bite down so hard their mouth would still be attached even if you try to pry it away.

Also usually it takes more than a few hours for the tick to actually infect you as it need to suck your blood first and then spit out some of it afterwards which carries the Lyme disease (ewww I know).

I mean it's always good to be safe but your risk should be minimal.
# Advice on treatment

# Anyone Born with Lyme gotten the covid vaccine?

## Comment #1


I was not born with Lyme but I have had it for ten years. I was perfectly fine after the first shot (Moderna). However, the second shot really knocked me out. Not just for one day like most healthy adults my age. My fatigue has been noticeably worse for the past two weeks, since I got the second shot.

I take a lot of supplements for fatigue already. I added a second dose of one of my supplements for mitochondrial dysfunction and this helped a lot. It's called ATP 360 by Researched Nutritionals. Usually I only take this supplement in the morning, but for now I am taking it morning and night.

There are plenty of other discussions about this topic on this subreddit if you use the search function. Some people have the typical reactions that healthy people do. I have only seen a few people report a worse reaction. There are a number of people who are avoiding the vaccine because they are worried about a bad reaction. It's a valid concern in my mind, and it's a very personal decision. I decided that I would rather risk a flare than risk long-haul Covid. However, the Covid cases in my area are really coming down now, so if I knew then what I know now, I might have waited longer to decide. Or even gotten only one dose of the vaccine, because the first dose is about 70% effective.
# Which is most responsible for memory loss?

## Comment #1


I forget.

Joking aside, I believe it’s the result of biotoxin exposure causing inflammation and damage to the brain. 

Recent research indicates Lyme leaves behind proteins similar to the Covid-19 spike protein that causes inflammation. When you kill Lyme and other bacteria they release biotoxins that also cause cytokine storms causing inflammation and brain damage. This is what I believe causes longterm immune damage and brain fog as well as memory loss.

The solution? Detox. Detox binders. Chelation. Remove all infections then use peptides to heal and reverse the damage (but only if the toxins are cleared and the infections are gone).

You basically have to treat it like you’re being poisoned as well as address the infections.
## Comment #2


Lyme can really do a number on your memory.

It can definitely improve with treatment though. I recently did a course of antibiotics followed by a course of disulfiram. I had to pause my treatment for non-medical reasons, so I was not on treatment for as long as planned. But I still saw significant improvement in my memory and brainfog. Honestly, when I was on disulfiram, I would have random memories pop into my head, like those particular neurons were suddenly waking back up. 

Are you in treatment at all?
# CBD with antibiotics?

## Comment #1


That's bizarre, I'd not heard that before and can't easily find anything to substantiate it.
## Comment #2


Look up what enzymes metabolize your specific antibiotics and then looks up what enzymes CBD inhibits or induced. If CBD is a substrate of those particular antibiotics then it is fine. If it weakly inhibits or induces those enzymes it should be alright but if it’s a mild or potent inhibitor or inducer I would def stay away as it can significantly reduce the effectiveness of your antibiotics. If you can’t find anything I would just stay away because it’s not worth making your antibiotics useless.
## Comment #3


I've been on Abx for a while and I take medical cannabis. Neither my LLMD nor my cannabis doctor said anything about interactions. In fact they encouraged use for pain. My antibiotics are working, very well.
## Comment #4


I’ve never heard of this. CBD is anti-microbial and can even herx you, so anything it does to the antibiotics it will make up for with its own healing and anti-microbial properties most likely.
## Comment #5


CBD will inactivate Cytochrome P450, which is responsible for metabolizing many common drugs, including doxycycline. This means that your blood level of doxycycline will be higher than it really should be. You may experience increased side effects like heartburn/nausea/vomiting, or more intense Herxing. Cefdinir is not effected by CBD because it isnt metabolized the same way.

This doesn't mean that you absolutely cannot use CBD, but you should definitely talk to your doctor about it. Since you are not yet a regular CBD user, it might just be better to wait until you are off the doxy before you start to take CBD.

I wrote a more [detailed explanation of Cytochrome P450 interactions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lyme/comments/jwg1mt/what_lyme_patients_should_know_about_cyp3a4_drug/) a few months back. Doctors are not always aware of the interactions between drugs, so I think it's important for patients to be informed about it.

Thanks for bringing this up. I wasn't aware of this interaction, and I do use CBD a bit.
# Is this a tick bite rash?

## Comment #1


It's hard to tell, but it's possible. It would be a good idea to get checked by a doctor.

I will give you some information that I would give to anybody with a tick bite. 

Most doctors will only prescribe 1-2 weeks of antibiotics for a tick bite. The International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society recommends 4-6 weeks. It may help to share [their guidelines](https://www.ilads.org/patient-care/ilads-treatment-guidelines/) with your doctor to advocate for a longer course.

With a longer course, it is important to take probiotics to replenish the healthy bacteria in your gut. Take it about 2 hours after every dose of antibiotics, so they don't get immediately killed off.

If you get doxycycline, be sure to take it with food.
# How long do rage episodes last?

## Comment #1


Bartonella die off?
## Comment #2


It could definitely be a herx reaction. Especially if anxiety or depression we're some of your symptoms before. How long have you been on azithromycin? I have been getting tics too since I started treatment. I'm on clarithromycin though.
## Comment #3


Had similar issues during treatment for Bart and lyme. Increase your detox… juicing, saunas, charcoal and clays, lemon water etc and it will level off. Try smoking cannabis to calm down
## Comment #4


Wim hof helps , its bartonella . Do you have stretch marks on your back or legs specifically inner thigh area?
## Comment #5


Sent you a PM
# I don't feel like a legit lyme patient...?

## Comment #1


You can complain as much as you like, don't worry. 

Its kinda the same with all illnesses - consider the current '19. Some people had sniffles, some were intubated and some died. But just because you only got the sniffles doesn't mean that you 'got it lucky'. A disease is a disease - not a moral standing. And Im sure you wouldn't think that of others. 

You were neurologically affected - that is a big deal. Its not a boo boo you can just stick a plaster on. I mean sure, no one wants to hear someone whinge over nothing all the time but a) I dont think that's what you're doing and b) you have brain damage! 

If you really want to 'give back' to those who do have worse symptoms then really the best thing you can do is raise awareness for the disease - at least where I am people just think its a minor irritant when we all know it isn't. Honestly by owning the fact that you have a chronic and serious illness will make others more aware and hopefully help protect them against what it can do
## Comment #2


You should always strive for the best quality of life you can obtain, you are taking nothing away from others who are worse.
## Comment #3


It's a symptom of Lyme disease.
## Comment #4


I think I can say for certain that no matter how Lyme has affected us individually, we all wish we never had it.

And that's the mystery with Lyme.  It affects each person differently according to how each person's body's immune system fights, and where the actual Lyme bacteria ends up in our bodies.
## Comment #5


how do you actually know you suffer from lyme when there is no test to prove you have it? is there an immediate connection between e.g. a tick bite and your symptoms appearing?
