#[JUMPSTART INCENTIVE](https://cdle.colorado.gov/colorado-jumpstart)

>The Colorado Jumpstart program is being offered to Colorado unemployment recipients who return to work between May 16 and June 26, 2021.

>During each weekly certification within MyUI+, Colorado unemployment claimants are asked, “Have you returned to work during this reporting period?” Eligible claimants who answer “Yes” to this question will be offered the opportunity to opt into the Colorado Jumpstart program. (Please see the screenshot below.) After you return to work, your unemployment claim will be inactivated, and you will no longer need to complete weekly unemployment certifications.

>If you file for unemployment benefits within eight weeks after opting into the Colorado Jumpstart program, you will forfeit any remaining unpaid incentive payments.

>*Note: The option to opt in to the Colorado Jumpstart program will only be presented to eligible claimants within the online MyUI+ system. Those certifying by phone using CUBLine will not be presented with this option. If you do not have internet access to opt in using MyUI+ but would like to participate in Colorado Jumpstart, please contact us at 303-536-5615, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.*

#[PROTECT YOURSELF FROM SCAMS](https://sites.google.com/state.co.us/uidailydashboard/scams?authuser=1)

CDLE will never ask for your personal information by text message or social media. Be wary of clicking links that purport to be from CDLE but don’t begin with ColoradoUI.gov or cdle.colorado.gov.

One of our users got a text message and confirmed it was a scam:
>Did anyone receive a text today that warns you that you need to login or lose benefits & gives what looks like a link to the clde ui login page - but leads you to a login page that asks for your username, password and pin? I’m waiting to call tomorrow to see if this is legit because tbh it feels like a phishing scam to me: https://i.imgur.com/mjBzCOr.jpg  
ETA: Yup, it was a scam text. I just went to ask at the clde site and found this https://sites.google.com/state.co.us/uidailydashboard/scams?authuser=1



The login page will NOT ask for your PIN. The ONLY thing we use a PIN for is the automated payment request CUBLine.

Hey Broc, I've been denied payment for the last 8 weeks. I've spoken to the 9000 number 3 times and each time the people say it's fixed and it never is. I'm at a very precarious point in my life, I'm out of hope and options. I spoke with them on Friday and nobody seems able to tell me exactly what is happening, and I was disconnected with no call back after 30 minutes. I really need this addressed and I'm not going to make it if I sit in a queue for another 3 weeks. I need help with this. Please help me.
## Comment #4


Anyone hearing anything about 4-6 month waits? I've been waiting since April 17th, was called back this Friday, June 04th. Agent told me, straight up, it's going to be 4-6 months and they'll only be able to do a few thousand a day.   


Said she was tired of lying to people and destroying families and basically told me good luck, find a job, and pray for backpay. The alternative would obviously be starving it out. I asked her how it got this bad she said "I don't know, sir".  


I was like this is inhumane, she dryly replied "I agree, but there's nothing we can do. Good luck." I was so in shock, I didn't even get the anxiety waves until the next morning, realizing I'd held on for months without proper assistance. 

&#x200B;

I'm gonna be honest, guys... if they're telling you days and weeks, unless you've got leprechaun in your family, prepare for the worst. Plenty of folks rn camping with their dogs waiting on CDLE. Dashboard is barely 1/10 through processing ID. Me holds.
## Comment #5


Today I got an unemployment check from Colorado and I haven't filed in months. Not sure what to do here. It says my claim is inactive and the website isn't really clear on how to make sure it's canceled. Tried calling but of course, no one answered. I didn't ask for this. Not sure what to do here...
## Comment #6


Kind of freaking out and need some help.

I received notifications from COUI saying I had documents that needed my review. I haven't been on unemployment for a little while now, after being on it from about April 2020 - April 2021.  I logged in my account to see what was going on, and there were documents entitled "Notice of Determination - Redetermination" waiting for my review.

Two of them stated that employers I had in 2019, because I had quit, "determined you are responsible for the separation and a disqualification is being imposed." In these same messages, it says:

"By law, we cannot pay you benefits based on the wages you earned from this employer. We must remove the money for those benefits from your claim. We might be able to pay you benefits based on wages you earned from other employers, if any. The amount of money you have left when we mailed this decision is $0."

I acknowledge that I quit from these jobs in 2019, and said so when filing for unemployment, but I didn't realize these would be an issue for my 2020 unemployment claim; I filed for unemployment in April 2020 after being laid off due to COVID from the company I had been working for at \*that\* time. That job, I know for certain that I would be certified to receive benefits for. 

I'm kind of panicking. Does this mean that I owe money and need to pay unemployment back? Obviously April 2020 - 2021 is a looong time to have received benefits and that'll be a lot to pay back, hence why I'm feeling sick to my stomach right now. What should I do? Do I file an appeal as mentioned in the documents? 

I feel like an "appeal" might not be quite applicable because I'm not contesting the fact that I quit these jobs... I'm just confused as to whether a 2019 job, which I had before the one I was actually laid off from in 2020, affected how much money I received for my 2020 claim? Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought the only company that would be paying into my unemployment would be the company that laid me off in April 2020, and that the job I was laid off from would ultimately be the deciding factor in my receiving benefits.

I apologize for being wordy. Any advice, insight, etc. would be appreciated.
# "State health site missing vaccination records to be used for $1 million drawings" [Instructions For Checking Your Record In Article]


Created: 2021-05-27 14:00:09



https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/state-health-site-missing-vaccination-records-to-be-used-for-1-million-drawings
## Comment #1


The best way to get this fixed is to take your CDC card to your health care provider and have them enter it into CIIS. If you have Kaiser and can see it in kp.org, but not CIIS, send me a DM, that could be an Epic issue, and I can get help for that.
## Comment #2


Is the search tool seriously locking us out after one try?  Laaaame.

Neither my spouse nor I were in the system, I was hoping to try searching again using common misspellings of my name on the chance the pharmacy recorded my info down incorrectly, but, yeah, we are locked out and can try again in 30 minutes.

EDIT:   OMG, they're banning at the IP level.  Mega laaaame.
## Comment #3


Saving you a click, [here's the link to check your record](https://ciis.state.co.us/public/Application/PublicPortal).
## Comment #4


I got vaccinated in Grand Junction, both doses. My info isn’t showing up. Is there someone I can call?

Edit: phone number worked!
## Comment #5


I had my 1st and 2nd shot at Denver Health in March... no record of it.

I'm looking at my vaccination card now, my name is correct... I'm sensing a civil lawsuit coming for the state to do a re-drawing or delay the drawing...

SO HOW DO I GET IN THE DRAWING!?
## Comment #6


My wife and I were vaccinated at a Safeway starting in March (First dose) and neither of our records are in CIIS.

&#x200B;

I wonder if this means the state has an incorrect count of our vaccine totals? Speculation here, but perhaps the Pharmacy Direct shots aren't making it into CIIS?
## Comment #7


After a few calls I got ahold of someone at Safeway that seemed to understand the root cause.

What they told me is that Safeway (and, presumably other Pharmacies) will only send records back to the state database (CIIS) for vaccines that were provided to them by the state - Which, in the case of Safeway is Moderna Only.

&#x200B;

Since I received the Pfizer vaccine, that information will never be relayed back to the state. They advised I be sure to not lose my card.
## Comment #8


I got vaxxed at UCHealth. My record showed up.
## Comment #9


I registered for my COIVD vaccine with my married name, but I was only able to find my record using my maiden name. Just a tip for anyone having trouble finding their records.
## Comment #10


I've gotten both doses and am not pulling up anything under their system. Anyone know how to correct this? I want my money. Lol
## Comment #11


More evidence that the record keeping on all of this has issues.  At the top level that state says we have given 2,969,454 people at least one dose and the CDC say its 3,063,061 or 93,607 more than the state (maybe that is the missing records people are finding?)

On the flip side the state says we have administered 5,634,160 total doses while the CDC says the number is 5,492,992 or 141,168 fewer doses.  Of course, the CDC also says that 99.9% of the over 65 population in Vermont has received at least 1 dose of vaccine which is obviously not correct.

In the end its about getting people vaccinated as fast as possible so the data being off a bit is not that big of a deal.  Of course, if you missed out on your 1 million bucks it would be a big deal to you.

The state has my record for my Covid shots as well as some but not all the vaccinations I have had in the past.  (The MMR shot I had in 1975 in Ohio when I was one is an impressive bit of record keeping).  I can’t find any record of my wife or daughter.
## Comment #12


Checked and mine is in there - from Thornton FD. Note that everything has to be the same as on your card, so if you used a proper name, you must use the same proper name on the search, etc.

I also note that other vaccines I received through Walgreens are also in the system.
## Comment #13


Mine is there from Weld County Health Department but my girlfriends isn’t
## Comment #14


I got mine at wallmart in commerce city. My vaccine is showing up on the states website. Lucky me!
## Comment #15


I entered the details with my phone number and my records didn't show. Then I tried with my e-mail I  booked the vax appointment through and my records showed up. I got vaxxed through Vail Health.

HOPEFULLY THIS HELPS
## Comment #16


My son and I got ours the same day. Same place. World arena mass VAX.  Mine shows his doesn’t.  My husbands doesn’t from Walmart. My daughters didn’t from Kings.  So we are 1/4 in showing up in the data base.
## Comment #17


If you have changed your name and gotten vaccines before your name change make sure to check under your first name. Nothing comes up under my married name but both my covid and childhood vaccines show up when I search under my maiden name.
## Comment #18


Only one of my shots shows up (I got the second two weeks ago Saturday). Should I email them or just wait?
## Comment #19


There is nothing for me.  I got mine at children's hospital as a care giver.
## Comment #20


Not showing up either. Well done government.
## Comment #21




I couldn't find mine so I emailed them. (Changing browsers and trying email instead of phone worked.)

Got this from CDPHE:
How to Use the Public Portal to Retrieve
Your Immunization Records

https://ciis.state.co.us/public/Application/PublicPortal

Patients and parents/guardians of minors under 18 can now use the Colorado Immunization Information
System (CIIS) Public Portal to view and print an official record of their immunizations. In order to retrieve your or your child’s immunization records, the patient information in CIIS must match what you are entering into the search. Immunization records printed from the CIIS Public Portal may not be complete. The records include what has been reported to and entered into CIIS.

Users must use Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or Mozilla Firefox to access the CIIS Public Portal.

Requirements for Retrieving Immunization Records:

● Patient information (first name, last name, date of birth, and gender) must match what is on the patient’s CIIS profile.

○ Note: If you or the minor you are requesting records for has had a name change, the patient
profile may need to be updated in order to access the records.

● There must be a mobile phone and/or email address on the patient’s CIIS profile that you have
access to, and it must match what is entered into the search.

○ Note: The mobile phone must be able to receive text (SMS) messages.

● If you are unable to access immunization records through the Public Portal, please contact the CIIS
Help Desk at cdphe.ciis@state.co.us to update the patient information.

● Note: The CIIS Help Desk will need to verify your identity before giving access to the requested records. If they are not able to verify your identity based on what is currently in CIIS, you will be instructed to contact your health care provider to update information, as needed.

## Comment #23


King Soopers for me. It's showing up.
## Comment #24


CVS/Target (Glendale) did show up. Where's my million?
## Comment #25


Are we supposed to upload our info somewhere? Do I need to call Polis’ office?
## Comment #26


Reading this thread I like my chances!
## Comment #27


Just a heads up, the first time I tried, I tried with the first email that my computer autfilled/had saved, and it didn't have records for me. That wasn't the email I signed up for the vaccine with.

When I went back and used the email I registered with, it worked. Worked with my phone number too.
## Comment #28


I’ve got both doses, not showing up. Neither is my partner.
## Comment #29


I got vaccinated in Grand Junction and mine isn't there either.
## Comment #30


Both my husband and mine showed up. We were vaccinated at different times and at different places. His was at his place of work (hospital) and mine was at a community site (Grand Junction). 

For those who are having issues, double check that the phone/email is the same one you used to register for the vaccine.
## Comment #31


The nurse who did mine said to make sure to keep my vaccine card since it was the only record I got it.
## Comment #32


I got vaccinated through Centura Health and mine shows up.
## Comment #33


Got my doses through Walmart and I'm not showing up in the system, I believe that is because they were federal pharmacy program rather than state?  I'm also interested in how this gets fixed as it seems it could cause problems in the future as well.
## Comment #34


Going dancing tonight will be worth $1 million. Can't wait.
## Comment #35


I got vaxxed at King Soops in Colorado Springs - both shots showing up. Just a FYI
## Comment #36


Got one through a community initiative and another through king Soopers - not in the database. Who do I call to fix this?
## Comment #37


I tried to search 3 times and now I'm locked out for 30 minutes. So great, thanks Colorado.
## Comment #38


I received mine at Centura Health in Thornton, my records are there. My husband received his at Safeway in Canon City, his are not.
## Comment #39


I did the vax at Ball Arena and doesn't show my records :(
## Comment #40


I got vaccinated in late January and late February at Rose Medical Center, HealthOne. The CIIS site has no record of me. Tried using both email and phone number -- no dice.
## Comment #41


I gotta say, I really think the rollout of this lottery is being botched.  So far the media stories on the day of the launch were all about how Polis made it seem like he was trying to sell everyone a Sham-WOW.  The day after all the media stories were almost hyperbolic about how many people were not in CIIS.

All of this is going to severely blunt the effectiveness of this effort.  Now people who might be vaccine-hesitant are just going to get the impression that they whole thing feels scummy and that they probably won't be in the system anyway, so they might as well not even bother.
## Comment #42


When I tried and gave it my email address, it said no records. When I put in my phone number, it had them.
## Comment #43


First dose with Mesa County Public Health in Grand Junction. (Pfizer)

Second dose with CVS/Target in Denver. (Pfizer)

Both in the CIIS system (had to search by phone number, not email)

\-----

Some prior CVS vaccinations where in there as well. I did manually update my insurance carrier's system with my vax card earlier this week.  Not sure if that had anything to do with the CIIS record being accurate.
## Comment #44


My records show up, but it says I got my second shot the same day as the first, when they were 28 days apart. What’s the best way to get it fixed?

Edit: Called my primary care doc and they directed me to someone at the local health department who was able to submit something to the state to get it corrected.
## Comment #45


Thank you, found out that my records are NOT in the system.
## Comment #46


Got 2 pfizer at SCL in lafayette and they're both in there.
## Comment #47


So far none of Colorado Active Duty, Reserve, Guard, or Veterans are included as the State has not reached out to military bases or the VA for vaccine information. Once the news gets a hold of that update Polis will be stuck in a big mess.
## Comment #48


Got mine at CVS, not in the database.  Tried calling CVS and couldn't get a hold of anyone.  Sent an email to the help address on the CIIS site and will see where that goes.
## Comment #49


I couldn't find mine either so I emailed the help desk.  I sent a picture of my ID and vaccine card along with my name, dob, phone number and email address.

I got a reply back confirming that my covid-19 vaccines were in CIIS. They also said they updated my information.

But I still can't access it! I get the same damn message about it not matching. What a joke.
# At least 70% of residents in 12 Colorado counties — including Denver, Boulder and Jefferson — are vaccinated

## Comment #1


https://covidactnow.org/us/colorado-co/county/boulder_county/?s=1913832

Why does the headline say Boulder is 70%+ of residence are vaccinated while Covid Act Now says 51% have 1+ dose and 43.3% are fully vaccinated?
## Comment #2


*ELIGIBLE population
## Comment #3


What a misleading headline -- it's even contradicted by the first paragraph.

In the Sun's defense, however, it appears to be a quickly-written day-of piece based off a press release, rather than their usual good original reporting.
## Comment #4


Good article, bad headline. It’s referring to one-dose percentages, so don’t read it as these counties have 70% fully-vaccinated (yet). But still, good news.

## Comment #3


It's time to start shaming anti-vaxxers on a mass scale. Let them know they're holding us all back from the end of this pandemic, that their "doubts" and "theories" about vaccines are misinformation, and that they're the weak link in our recovery from a devastating year. I'm sick of hearing people saying "well, it's their choice, we can't force them..."   


Bullshit. Start telling anti-vaxxers they're not welcome around your families, your parties, or your community until they step up and do the right thing to end this. Let them know they're not welcome among folks who made the choice to ensure their families and neighbors are safe.  


I don't want to see these reports every day saying "it's stable, maybe a dip here, maybe an increase here." We have the solution right in front of us and the only thing holding us back is the stupidity and fear of the people in our lives not willing to take it.

TLDR: 1.7% of the state's cases since mid-Jan. have been in fully-immunized people. In other words, 0.1% of people in Colorado who have been fully immunized have developed COVID-19.
## Comment #2


This doesn't--and probably can't--take differing behaviors into account. Everyone I know who got the vaccine early is still being cautious, wearing masks, avoiding crowded indoor spaces, and not willingly interacting with strangers or known anti-vaxxers up close. 

I had to go to King Soopers in person recently, and probably 85% of people were acting like the whole pandemic was over, so I'm going to try to avoid it from now on. 

BTW, if anyone knows a grocery store that still has mask requirements, let me know.

## Comment #1


High and low case rate counties different by more than chance

* Lots of increasing cases today, not a welcome thing.
* Douglas joins the high list with a big week of new cases

Statewide 7 day case rate

* Up just a bit to 75. We can hope it's a fluke.

Highest case (not rate) percentage increase

* 25 counties increased case numbers, including all but two of the 100K+ person counties. Neither is welcome.

Highest case rate (7 day per 100,000 people)

* Mesa goes up from yesterday, double the second largest and triple any other large population county. When will their spring variant surge end? Most likely when they start getting more serious about vaccination.

Comparing vaccination and case rates

* Today's rates for both, and the total percent of population vaccinated number. The tale is clear - vaccinations lower new cases.

5 day moving average of new cases

* Mesa hanging on to their surge and El Paso not dropping quickly - but we already knew that from the tables.
## Comment #2


I think the cases for Douglas may be really old and just getting reported.

CDPHE has a 7 day rate of 44.7 for Douglas.

7 day average has hit a plateau for the last 5 days or so. Hopefully it starts to trend back down tomorrow.

I would be curious to see what percent of these new cases are coming from Mesa county alone. Their rate is way higher than pretty much any other county of a similar population.

I am hopeful that the debacle of Jon Rahm having to withdraw from the Memorial Classic Golf Tournament this past weekend due to a positive COVID test -- and losing the very likely opportunity to win $1.675M in  the process -- nudges a few more non-vaxxers to change their minds.

It is the 10 year anniversary of the brewery and CDPHE will be providing J&J one shot. You get a free beer for getting the shot. Pass the word around for those still needing a vaccine.

*Fixed a silly mistake that led to occasional incorrect reporting of case rates on the first image.* 

Hot and Cold Counties - different by more than chance

* Mesa and El Paso at the top of the unusually high case rates. At least El Paso has falling cases.

Statewide per capita 7 day case rate

* Case rate of 73 is basically the same as the last week-ish. We're stuck around 70. 

Percentage increase in cases (not rates)

* 21 counties with increasing cases, including 5 in the 100K+ person counties
* The big increases in the top 12 are counties that jumped from 1 case to 10 or 12. Not unusual for that kind of thing to happen although it is certainly unfortunate for all concerned.

Highest 7 day per capita case rate

* Mesa and El Paso still significantly higher than the other 100K+ person counties, and with the lowest vaccination rates, too.
* 3 counties over 0.25% case rate.

Vaccination rates compared to 7 day case rates

* I use the vaccination rate of the total population, not the vaccination rate in those eligible for the vaccine by the way. Everyone who gets sick can spread the disease.
* Fairly obvious relationship helps show the effectiveness of vaccines and on broad adoption of vaccines. 

5 day moving average of new cases in largest population counties

* Long term view of where we are now. Nice to see Denver and Adams running near last summer's new case count for instance.
