To the people who are lying to my wife's practice and coming in sick:  go fuck yourself.
## Comment #2


I got my first Moderna dose yesterday in Brenham!  Yay.  My arm is sore today but that is it.  Next one scheduled for March 10th.
## Comment #3


The new allocation is out for this week:

Unless I'm missing another list it looks like pharmacies will not get any this week in favor of hubs.
## Comment #4


I am a professor in Religious Studies program at Texas State University. I am currently seeking to interview individuals living in Texas who have lost a loved one to COVID-19 to understand how this loss affected their own spirituality, what steps were taken wither within or outside of religious institutions to commemorate or honor the individual, and how their own understanding of religion, death, and grieving having intersected for them. This is a terrible time for so many reasons and I want to document individual voices describing their own experiences. 

If you or someone you know has lost a loved one to COVID and are willing to speak with me, either via Zoom, a phone interview, or answering written questions, please DM me. Religious Studies is a broad field, and we can't even agree on what it is we study, so I would to get a variety of voices, whether they be Christian Buddhist, Secular / Atheist, Jewish, Muslim or what have you. Really, no experience of thought is too minor.
## Comment #5


77,000 vaccinations posted in the last 24 hours on the tracker roughly 25% of all vaccinations to date. Looks like either reporting is getting better, we are administering more or a combination of both. Regardless good news.

## Comment #6


Does anyone know how to register for a vaccine?  My wife works in a private practice and is kind of on her own to get a vaccine. But it seems like you have to contact medical providers directly to register?

Is that true?  Is there really no centrally managed vaccine registration/management system? Did they really fuck this up that badly?
## Comment #7


I don’t know where to ask this so if you know of a better place please tell me...but I’m seeing testing facilities who benefit from the CARES act telling people they need to come back for repeat testing that isn’t recommended or required. I’m concerned about wasted and fraudulent use of CARES act monies. Because of my job, I’m following up with people who have tested positive for COVID and determining when they can return to work. We follow the CDC guidelines. I’ve noticed that many of the private COVID testing facilities are telling positive patients that they need to return for another test  after their 10 days of isolation are over, presumably to see if they test negative. These are facilities that will test uninsured and insured without charging the individual (no cost/no copay) as part of the CARES act. I assume they get reimbursed by the government for what insurance doesn’t pay and for testing uninsured. I realize that hospitals and inpatient facilities have reason to repeat test, but AFAIK there’s no reason to retest in someone w a normal immune system who has seen their symptoms improve and been fever-free for at least 24 hrs if it’s been at least 10 days from the onset of their illness. These people are told that they need to come back for another test and they don’t know that this isn’t required to return to work per CDC recommendations until I talk to them. Is it a waste of time/energy to try to report this? Idk who or where I would report my concerns to. I don’t want any barriers to testing and I think anyone should be able to get a test if they want one so maybe there’s no way to avoid companies taking advantage.
## Comment #8


I’m suppose to get my second dose this week in Houston but the grocery store I got the first at is completely out and may not have any for weeks. Every other place I’ve called either is out or can’t give me a second dose of I didn’t get the first with them. I’m a healthcare worker and getting nervous about this. Advice?
## Comment #9


When the fuck are essential workers going to be eligible?
## Comment #10


I just want to see if I'm understanding vaccine distribution correctly, please tell me if this is correct.

When I register for a county's vaccine waiting list, that only puts me in line for state-run places like the mass-vax sites, fire departments, etc right? Signing up for a county's list would not ever notify me that I'm eligible for an appointment at CVS or Walmart? To go there, I have to sign up with CVS or Walmart independently right?
## Comment #11


Was thinking of visiting a friend i havent seen in a while, that lives in Houston. Any guidance on whether or not I should?
## Comment #12


I was at grapevine mills mall on Sunday and noticed that about half of the patrons weren’t wearing masks. And it was still extremely crowded with lines to get into certain stores. Did these people forget there’s a pandemic? We’re in the final stretch. Let’s do better folks
## Comment #13


Can someone explain this link from the NIH:

[Informed consent disclosure to vaccine trial subjects of risk of COVID‐19 vaccines worsening clinical disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7645850/?fbclid=IwAR3m8einm_sZJu46BfTNZ2Yugq-dBdsYmzstuZXVgY7ndWGpVsHny9YUZ28)

My anti-vaxx relatives are circulating it on Facebook as "evidence" that the vaccines have the opposite effect and make COVID worse.  I think it's a paper trying to sound like a disclaimer but not actually based on specific data.

If someone more knowledgeable could explain it, I'd appreciate it.

There’s almost 400 available first dose appointments today in Killeen. Get vaccinated if you haven’t already! https://curative.com/sites/27565?fbclid=IwAR12YL9GyjCkZQSn7n2YaLz110tWp31KGl9NUnD3qHQ5cNvtds-uvwlu2KI
## Comment #17


Are there any 1b vaccinations that have started?
## Comment #18


I work in an office; everyone wears masks. I eat lunch outside on a circular picnic table. It's one of the few times I take my N95 mask off during the workday. A coworker asked me if he could join me for lunch, should I say yes? I've considered measuring the diameter of the table to see if it's 6 feet wide, but it seems a bit silly.
## Comment #19


So I saw that people with type 2 diabetes are in the 1B group. Would a measly type 1 diabetic like myself also be in 1B, or would I be in a later phase?
## Comment #20


Seems like way more vaccine doses arriving for this next week, good news!
## Comment #21


Exactly what is it you are discussing which cannot be gleaned from watching 10 minutes of local news?
## Comment #22


Tomorrow will vaccine be avail for new age group?
## Comment #23


How does one remove themself from the Dallas County vaccine pre-registration list?
## Comment #24


I'm over 50 and got my first Moderna dose yesterday. I live in West Austin, Hays County. I had my name on 3 waiting lists: Hays County, Austin public health, and UT. But starting March 15, HEB was offering vaccines to 50+, so I kept an eye on their listing and got an appointment for this Friday...would be a 2 hour drive from here. So I was planning on that, but that evening, my clinic, Community Care, texted me an address where I could go anytime (no appointment needed) to get vaccinated. I showed up the next day, and there were hardly any people there and I got it done lickety split! So I was able to cancel my HEB appointment I had later in the week. I hope all of you get as fortunate as I did!!
## Comment #25

## Comment #26


Looking at vaccinspotter, there's large green spots out in the middle of nowhere.  So do these doses go mostly wasted?
## Comment #27


Does anyone know when I can get tested at low cost or free if I don't have insurance?
## Comment #28


Man all this vaccine talk is making me jealous. I’m 37 and am not even part of a rollout that’s been given a date yet. Like I don’t exist in terms of getting one here in Australia.

# Houston Methodist suspends 178 hospital workers for not complying with COVID vaccine mandate

## Comment #1


My friend is gonna have a shit fit if that trickles down to all hospitals. She’s adamant about not getting vaccine and she treated COVID patients and seen suffer  them die. Why she wants that for herself who knows. But yet again, she says virus is fake and when she got it it was just like the flu too. There’s some sort of misfiring going on in her head.
## Comment #2


These suspensions represent about 0.75% of Methodist's ~25,000 person workforce, the last few holdouts against COVID-19 vaccinations. Another 300-400 employees received a health related deferral (pregnancy, etc.) or a religious exemption, so in total, around 97-98% of Methodist employees are fully vaccinated.

I hope anyone who changes their mind can find a J&J vaccine; they only have two weeks to get vaccinated before they might lose their jobs.
## Comment #3


Good. Hospital patients are medically fragile and captive. They shouldn’t be put at further risk just because some dumbasses won’t get their vaccines.
## Comment #4


Good, can’t really do your job is you don’t believe in basic science.
## Comment #5

## Comment #7


Like before, Abbott et al keep the epidemic going for all of us.

It will be slightly different in that there are states very close to the herd immunity treshold and for those states, the epidemic is over. Even if there is interestate travel and the defenses of the vaccinated states come under attack by the malaise of the unvaccinated states, herd immunity should hold the line.

People that travel to and from unvaccinated states should have a difficult time finding vulnerable victims in vaccinated states. There will be the ocassional immunocompromised or otherwise vulnerable who will pay the ultimate price, but it shouldn't start a local epidemic.

All I gotta say is: Gay. Cake. Bitches. If someone really wants to fight it invoking this SC ruling should be as easy as: “My belief system dictates that I cannot service individuals that aren’t vaccinated”. And last I checked being vaccinated or not sure as hell isn’t a federally protected class.

## Comment #7


I'm holding off on an opinion at this point. I suspect this is a not completely-in-good-faith compromise. Sure, we won't "require" vaccinations, but you will need to pay extra for daily rapid tests, wear mask at all times outside the cabin, pcr test prior to only  approved excursions (that will be extra$$), etc..

In my experience with the covid anti vaxxers(which are different from your typical anti vaxxers)&anti-maskers...these folks like to talk big, but if something becomes an inconvenience or costs extra, they are not gonna follow through. So they will cancel a cruise before having to do extra work into it because it's not fair, discrimination, how dare you!I'm gonna cancel you!  *eyeroll*
## Comment #8


I hope an outbreak happens and no country will let the ship make port and the passengers will have to endure 14 additional days of buffet and bad karaoke.

# Only 545,000 vaccine doses were administered in Texas during the week of May 30th. This was the second week in a row with a greater than a 20% decline in week-over-week vaccinations. Currently only 54% of Texans have at least one vaccine dose and 44% are fully vaccinated.

## Comment #1


Data ingested daily from [Texas DSHS](https://tabexternal.dshs.texas.gov/#/site/THD/views/COVID-19VaccineinTexasDashboard/Summary) for my [Texas COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker](https://covid-texas.csullender.com/vaccine/). Chart created using Python. This plots the week-over-week change in the "doses administered" metric. You can see the [Jupyter notebook here](https://github.com/shiruken/covid-texas/blob/master/vaccine_visualize.ipynb).

Additional charts:

* [Daily COVID-19 Vaccine Doses Administered](https://i.imgur.com/hUX15kT.png)
* [Weekly Number of People Receiving First COVID-19 Vaccine Doses](https://i.imgur.com/Z4qvCRg.png)
* [Daily Number of People Receiving First COVID-19 Vaccine Doses](https://i.imgur.com/Vv8APs5.png)

Of the 545,000 doses administered last week, 260,000 went to people receiving their first vaccine dose. Assuming this rate of new vaccinations persists (which is unlikely), it will take over 24 weeks for 70% of eligible Texans (aged 12+) to receive at least their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. However, it is quite likely that vaccinations will continue to drop in the coming weeks, rendering the 70% goal all but impossible.
## Comment #2


The people who care have already been vaccinated.
## Comment #3


Wow We'll likely never hit >60% with these numbers
## Comment #4


Thanks to the54% we are getting this under control... and the Covidiots will never thank the people who are getting the vaccines.  They'll just say, "see I told ye I don't need no vaccine."
## Comment #5


Two close family members were recently hospitalized here in TX.   Why they haven't been vaccinated in unknown.  And they have a small child.  UG!!
## Comment #6


And maybe this is too judgmental, but you can spot the non-vaccine types from a mile away here in Texas. So if you're still practicing good social distancing, they're easy to avoid.
## Comment #7


Jesus Christ, I hate people.
## Comment #8


That’s abysmal and pathetic. This state sucks at some things.
## Comment #9


I suspect when the vaccines get full FDA approval, there will be a small bump in people getting them, but I doubt we get more than 60-65%. 

Even if we don’t get to 60%, the trends are all moving in the right direction.  In fact, I suspect that by the end of the summer these subs will be mostly irrelevant (they basically are now) and the media will largely stop reporting anything about Covid, but I guess that dropped off significantly once Biden took office.
## Comment #10


I still think end of September is the big and final test. Baring any major variant causing an unforseen restart.

August will have a surge from July 4th. Delta variant already causing issues in states. It will happen here too, even if only minor compared to January numbers.

Mid August is also opening of all schools and colleges. Abbot basically won't allow any state funded entity to protect itself. So all colleges and schools are going to be 0 distance, 0 mask, 0 anything. Dorms will be full.

In fact, sadly, only around 100 colleges of the 5200 in America are requiring vax right now. So expect this to be an issue everywhere.

Texas, especially UT Systems, has a fairly large international and out of state student base. August will see a huge surge of travel all over the USA.

DHHS Data shows college age students are least vaccinated. Heard that around Dallas most of the colleges have only 20% of their students getting vaccinated based on surveys.

So add that all up, and we are likely looking at a fair amount of steps backwards in September.

I fully expect all reporting from colleges and schools to stop. As they have no recourse anymore. Texas government tied their hands. 

But, if we get lucky, and it passes by without major issues, there is currently no other major event with so many statistical problems on the horizon.

And all of this could be avoided if we just had enough people willing to get vaccinated. Unfortunate, considering a year from now it is extremely likely 90% of places will require covid vax proof once it is FDA approved. It isn't a new thing, they already do that with other vax types...

"expert panel, composed of five doctors and four health care providers, that will be charged with providing recommendations to the chief epidemiologist during declared emergencies or disasters."

Sounds like a plan....but

"new law requiring public health orders to be periodically reviewed by local elected officials."

So we will have "local elected officials" reviewing recommendations by health professionals. The problem here is that your local elected official could be a barely educated yokel that won a popularity contest by coming in first at the cow chip throwing contest three years in a row.

I love Texas...I hate Texas.
## Comment #2


Wouldn't 'vaccine passports' be a federal thing, not state? This is them pandering the idiots, right? Last I checked, that's only regarding foreign travel & it's just the card they give you recording your vaccination history. 

>Lawmakers also passed legislation that requires the state to contract   
with U.S. companies for personal protective equipment (and not with   
foreign companies) 

The only reason most PPE came from China was because US stocks were depleted early on. They just sabotaged the state from curtailing another pandemic which will come soon considering how many fools stopped taking them seriously.
