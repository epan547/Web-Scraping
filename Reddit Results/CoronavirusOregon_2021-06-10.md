## Comment #1


As part of Oregon's ongoing campaign to confuse and piss off the populace, I just received an email from [getvaccinated.oregon.gov](https://getvaccinated.oregon.gov), saying that I could use their chatbot to schedule an appointment. Surprise! That's not what it does. 

Here's the relevant text:

>People who live in Clackamas, Columbia, Marion, Multnomah or Washington counties can use our chatbot to make an appointment. Go to [covidvaccine.oregon.gov](https://covidvaccine.oregon.gov) and click on the orange box in the bottom right corner of your screen. Once you’ve answered some questions, you’ll be connected to scheduling tools hosted by local vaccine providers.

It ONLY checks to see whether you're eligible or not, then tells you to register. That's it. Maybe that's the plan, but ???
## Comment #2


Today, I obtained a notice from and signed up for a vaccine appointment for March 15 via GetVaccinatedOregon . com.  

So the system is working. And vaccines apparently beginning to flow.
## Comment #3


How do I get an appointment at the Convention Center?  I signed up at getvaccinated.oregon.gov but when I log in I see no where to check appointment availability at the Convention Center.
## Comment #4


hey... if you're struggling to get an appointment for ANY reasons....  complicated work schedule, or you want a specific vaccine, or you need special accommodation or transportation... if you're just really really scared of needles... I can help. I can tell you where to get a vaccine, help set the appointment, and I can drive you and hold your hand, or tell you which locations are best for accomodation.
## Comment #5


Trying to find a Johnson and Johnson vaccine for my 74 year old grandma.... it’s unfortunately the only one she is willing to get and getting her to this point has taken months. Need to jump and get a shot in her ASAP. 

Anyone have tips on where to look for J&J?
## Comment #6


I was able to schedule a vaccination appointment at [Walgreens.com](https://Walgreens.com) this morning. I think the secret is to get online early. I signed in about 7am and there were many appointment slots open at my preferred location. Also, unlike yesterday, it let me schedule both dose appointments.

Unfortunately, I am still waiting for the confirmation email over an hour later. Guess they haven't quite got all the glitches ironed out!

Update: Confirmation email from Walgreens finally arrived at 5:23pm, so only 10 hours after I scheduled the appointment.
## Comment #7


Do you think that a person can make a vaccination appointment at a pharmacy in another county? Or do you have to stay in your home county? I haven't heard anything definitive either way
## Comment #8


I'm in Yamhill county which apparently can't get it's shit together. Am I able to sign up for a vaccine in a different county?
## Comment #9


I'm in Washington County, 59, no underlying health conditions, work in a manufacturing environment and per the website says I do not qualify and will be contacted when I will be able to get the vaccine. 
I'm going down the depression rabbit hole..I'd like to see my family in another state again, especially my parents.
## Comment #10


I tried Walgreens at 8 so I guess I’ll have to start early. I got a call back from 211 to schedule an appointment at the airport but the woman said the website was down. I had tried earlier and found the same thing online. So that’s it for the day.
## Comment #11


So apparently, there are at least 3 appointment systems for vaccination; The OHA, OHSU, and walgreens. 

Are there any others?
## Comment #12


Is anyone finding vaccination appointments using https://vaccinefinder.org ? And are WalMarts offering shots yet?
## Comment #13


Vaccine information by county:

## Comment #14


I'm not raring up to get my vaccine ASAP as I'm in a very privileged work and life situation right now, but I am curious about something...  


One of the health conditions listed for current vaccine eligibility is current or former smoker. I was a pot smoker for 7 years up until last year. Does this include marijuana smokers? Once again, I have no plans on getting the vaccine at this moment, but I can't find any clarification on my own.   


In my case, cannabis was on my medical record and I did suffer from chronic bronchitis for a few years (also on my medical record), but it's been almost three years since my last major flare up, which I assume is related to my tapering down and eventually quitting the substance.   


Does anyone have any insight? I'm curious, I assume my risk is now low, but I'm still doing what I can in the meantime.
## Comment #15


Has anyone else not heard anything from the Get Vaccinated site after signing up? I was confirmed eligible, but the only email I've ever gotten from them was for verifying my email, which was 5 days ago. It sounds like they're supposed to notify you of appointments, but I'm worried that i did something wrong.

I can't find available appointments anywhere, and my insurance, Kaiser, is backed up to phase 1a. I'm getting anxious about availability opening to everyone soon, kind of worrying that I won't be able to get one for months even though I'm higher risk.
## Comment #16


I just got my boyfriend and I appointments for Saturday at the fairgrounds. Does anyone have any advice for how early to arrive before our appointment? I don't want to be one of those people who hop in line far earlier than our appointment and skip ahead of others who have appointments before us.
# What You Need to Know About Getting Vaccinated in PDX, updated 6/1/21 (things have changed)


Created: 2021-06-01 15:46:08

Our mass vaccination sites (Oregon Convention Center/OHSU at the Airport) are closing down.

**IF YOU NEED A FIRST SHOT OF PFIZER/MODERNA**

Your options are now to go to a pharmacy (Walgreens, Fred Meyer, etc). While most of these places don't show appointments for many weeks, most offer walk ins and almost all have spare doses at the end of the day. It is now reasonable to call the pharmacy directly to ask if they can fit you in. Generally, in PDX proper, Walgreens offer Pfizer and Walmart/Safeway offer Moderna, but this is not always true. [https://www.vaccines.gov/](https://www.vaccines.gov/) can give you some better info. Remember, 12-18 year olds can ONLY get Pfizer.

**IF YOU NEED A SECOND SHOT OF PFIZER/MODERNA**

You can still go to [Oregon Convention Center](https://all4oregon.org/) or [OHSU at the Airport](https://www.ohsu.edu/health/vaccine-scheduling-jhse) for second doses of Pfizer (OCC) or Pfizer and Moderna (OHSU at the Airport), but only until June 19th. While you don't need an appointment, its helpful to check the sites mostly to see what days they're open. OHSU at the airport is now the only drive thru site in PDX. The CDC rules last month that ALL vaccination locations MUST give you a second dose even if you got your first dose someplace else. You do not need to get your second dose in the same place. [LeCare Pharmacy](https://www.lecarepharmacy.com/) is offering walk in appointments for all three vaccines.

**If you'd like the One Shot Johnson & Johnson Vaccine**

OCC will offer this on specific days, as will OHSU. Check the links provided for info on what days. Rite Aids offer the J and J shot as a walk in, but are only open for vaccines Tues-Sat.

**Other Options**

Smaller "pop up" clinics are always opening - [this site](https://www.multco.us/novel-coronavirus-covid-19/upcoming-covid-19-vaccination-clinics) lists them, and gives you specifics about what is offered, when and how to get it.

**Special Notes for 12-18 Year Olds**

In Oregon, citizens 15 years and over have medical sovereignty. This means they should not need parental permission to receive a vaccine. But in reality, many corporate chains (Walgreens/Kroger, possibly others) have policies that do not allow pharmacists to honor Oregon law. If you are a 15-17 yr old and want to be vaccinated, you'll want to go to one of the [Multnomah County sponsored ](https://www.multco.us/novel-coronavirus-covid-19/upcoming-covid-19-vaccination-clinics)[clinics](https://www.multco.us/novel-coronavirus-covid-19/upcoming-covid-19-vaccination-clinics), listed here, or Safeway, Albertsons or Sav-On or LeCare. [Click here](https://getvaccinated.oregon.gov/#/locator) for more help.

**If you are undocumented**

LeCare Pharmacy asks for an ID, but if you tell them you do not have one, they simply ask you to print out your name and vaccinate you anyways. There is no onsite security/police presence, although there might be at the Trader Joes around the corner, just FYI. If this feels like the right situation for you and you need a ride/advocate, I will take you. 

**If you need help, are scared, need special accommodations, have questions, need a ride**

I'm a PDX local and I'm really happy to help. Whether that's driving you, helping you find the vaccine you want, answering questions about your concerns, or even going with you and advocating for you or holding your hand, or doing whatever you need to help create an environment you feel safe in. I'll work to make it happen. Just send me a chat or message.

The above is not exhaustive, and I'm sure people will follow up with some notes about additional locations and tips. These are my opinions about the best and easiest ways to get vaccinated right now.

Would it be OK with you to sticky this post?
## Comment #3


In your opinion what would be the best option for vaccinating a family member with dementia who will be very disruptive and can come across as being aggressive?
## Comment #4


I’m surprised pharmacies are so packed with appointments, I feel this will just hinder people more in getting it if they are not very determined to get it. It was extremely frustrating for me to get a pharmacy appt back before I secured one at a mass vaccination drive through event. Are there any plans for vaccination events for underserved communities? Los Angeles is shutting down their mass vaccination sites but switching to a mobile clinic model.
# Risk of rapid evolutionary escape from biomedical interventions targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (WARNING: this does not look good)


Created: 2021-06-10 13:53:23

## Comment #1


Can someone explain this to me? The article is very scientific and I didn't quite grasp all of it.
## Comment #2


The authors are basically saying don’t put all our (humans) eggs in one basket vaccine-wise because they have found that the effectiveness of specific molecules diminishes with time and with mutations that the organism that induces covid symptoms undergoes.

From the article: “Our modeling suggests that SARS-CoV-2 mutants with one or two mildly deleterious mutations are expected to exist in high numbers due to neutral genetic variation, and consequently resistance to vaccines or other prophylactics that rely on one or two antibodies for protection can develop quickly -and repeatedly- under positive selection. Predicted resistance timelines are comparable to those of the decay kinetics of nAbs raised against vaccinal or natural antigens, raising a second potential mechanism for loss of immunity in the population. Strategies for viral elimination should therefore be *diversified across molecular targets and therapeutic modalities*.”
## Comment #3


Not good! Thanks for sharing however.
## Comment #4


I don’t see how this doesn’t go from voluntary to country mandatory vaccinations and boosters.
## Comment #5


Considering how little of the world is vaccinated this is very bad news. Mutations as you know can occur when the virus replicates. The more people it infects the more potential for mutation, hence the appearance of the more infectious variants out currently. In the case of the first SARs it burned hard and fast, people died too quickly for it to spread quickly. However the current covid19 variants have their infection rate dialed in -up to ten days of presymptomatic potential to infect. A single person can infect hundreds. Those hundreds can affect thousands before detection. Taiwan was a stellar model of keeping the virus out for over a year. But all it took was a few people who did not quarantine long enough and now they have hundreds of deaths, thousands infected when it went undetected for a mere couple weeks. People happy about life going back to normal need to understand it is too soon unfortunately to celebrate.
## Comment #6


Does this not just mean that in the worst case we might need boosters each year to retain full immunity?  Keep in mind the virus has mutated thousands of times already, and yet it still appears that the original vaccine (based on the genetic code of the initial variant that appeared first in China) is still highly effective, even if its "reduced" for some variants, it is still good enough to prevent severe disease.

Now we have the supply chain for vaccine production and distribution running at full tilt, a proven process for creating the vaccines which can be easily tweaked to use a different generic target, and the FDA has already indicated that variant boosters won't have to go through the same lengthy review process.  

I just don't see us at risk of slipping back into "full pandemic" at any point.  To me this just points to the often stated hypothesis that COVID-19 will end up as the 5th circulating endemic Coronavirus strain and will typically cause only mild illness by that point.

# Gilliam Co Oregon .. week ending 6/9/21 .. new cases per M per week going to new highs for the duration of the pandemic


Created: 2021-06-10 15:34:07



https://i.redd.it/ofwcn9lajg471.png
## Comment #1


Whoops - guess a bar chart would have probably been better.

Gilliam Co's max previously-seen rate (new cases per M per week) was week ending 5/12/21 at 3,434. The current rate is 133% that at 4,579.

Per the OHA dashboard, the %population vaccinated numbers for Gilliam are 34.1% for the whole population and 39.3% for the eligible population. (left column in the lower pane [at this page](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oregon.health.authority.covid.19/viz/OregonCOVID-19VaccineEffortMetrics/StatewideProgress))

(We're relatively lucky. There is a county in Texas, Maverick, population 52K, that is now seeing 5x its previously seen max rate of new cases .. 92,290 new cases per M per week. That's insane. I sincerely hope that is not a preview of what happens when new variants encounter poorly-vaccinated communities.)

* Childcare: 16 (16/17/19)
* Schools K—12: 308 (328/354/389)

Outbreaks are down significantly in the Senior & Congregate Living category, higher in Workplaces and flat in Childcare. Schools are lower but still showing the largest number of outbreaks. There are three (3) workplace outbreaks from **2020** that are **still not resolved**. The largest active school outbreak is 58 cases at Bend High School.

(I'm tracking these numbers to gauge what effect vaccinations and risk level changes are having on outbreaks)

Note: OHA limits what information is released in the Outbreak Report: 

* Senior and Congregate Living facilities with less than 6 residents and less than 4 cases are not reported.

* Workplaces with less than 30 employees and less than 5 cases are not reported.

* Childcare facilities with less than 17 students and less than 3 cases are not reported.

* Schools with less than 30 students are not reported.

Be kind! Be patient! Be safe! Please vaccinate!

Good morning everyone .. ran the fresh numbers (week ending 6/9/21 and set of rolling weeks going backwards) and saw that Gilliam Co, Oregon is now at its highest weekly rate of new cases for the duration of the pandemic. Anyone know what's going on there?

(there's some crazy shit happening at the county level in other states, just be glad it's not here)

## Comment #2


I propose we remove vax refusers from the denominator. The rest of us agree with them that we don't want them to be vaccinated, so medically speaking we all agree that they don't count. The vaccine is VERY effective so now that we have given it to the willing, maximizing the virus spread (and minimizing medical intervention) is a policy nobody disagrees with.
# Benton Co - last year vs this year - data through 6/8/21 - this is the overall most vaccinated county in Oregon, so what happens next will be interesting to see through the data.
