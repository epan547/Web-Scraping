98% of covid hospitalizations in Bend, OR since March are unvaccinated people. This stat needs to be repeated over and over.

## Comment #3


All these chicken littles like Eric Feigl-Ding that have tried to scare people week after week about each scary new variant have really poisoned the "concern" water. Even if the delta variant does finally turn out to be something notable in the US (and I'm not convinced it will), the repeated "we're all gonna die!!!!!!" that's been preached by these people over and over and over and over and over has gotten people to tune out.
## Comment #4


Are we at a point of why do we need a mask on the USA?
## Comment #5


What's this story about cleveland clinic saying vaccine doesn't help much if you've already been sick? I was so close convincing my reluctant family to go get the shots and then this story came out.

It's not peer reviewed so we gotta take it with some salt, but now this throws more fuel into the reluctance.
## Comment #6


Super good and exciting news (for me) in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S!

Just heard that the high school senior of mine's graduation, scheduled for June 15th, had the mask mandate removed!
 
The school was kinda lax about enforcing the masks outdoors at the HS senior class events yesterday (June 8th) and June 3rd, despite saying masks were required.

Nice to have some normalcy for him before graduation and finishing American high school.
## Comment #7


The UK has again increasing case numbers, apparently driven by delta variant, which has increasing share and absolute number of cases. The public NHS data doesn’t have enough details however to draw conclusions. 

Are there already any papers or scientific reports analysing this phenomenon?
## Comment #8


From what I've seen locally, incentive programs sound good but don't seem to actually motivate people.

Minnesota launched an incentive program a couple weeks ago, offering people who initiated vaccination between end of May and end of June a number of prizes, including amusement passes and VISA gift cards. Since the program launched, only ~5,200 people have claimed a prize and the new vaccination rate in the state continues to absolutely crater. 

In the seven days prior to Memorial Day, the state averaged about 7,400 first doses per day to the 16+ population (0.17% of total 16+ pop). Since Memorial Day it's about 4,300 (0.09%). 

There's essentially no way the state gets to 70% of the 16+ population with a shot by July 1st, and frankly little-to-no chance it gets there by August 1st based on the trends and numbers coming from the state, which all things considered seems to be middle of the road nationally when it comes to vaccination trends. 

I think we're effectively done with the vaccination campaign except extremely targeted community outreach, a small bump from <12 eligibility in the fall, and a small bump from mandates once vaccines receive full approval.
## Comment #9


If we get a new wave of infections from Delta it will 100% be the fault of people who won’t get vaccinated and the people (including certain political leaders) who downplayed Covid and encouraged the anti vaccine mindset.
## Comment #10


Why is the UK seeing a surge but not the US or even Europe, strikes me as very odd
## Comment #11


Does anyone have family members/friends who are still scared/paranoid even after being fully vaccinated? I live with my parents, all 3 of us are fully vaccinated but my dad still freaks out when I leave the house, I have a hair appointment today after not doing my hair since the pandemic started and he keeps telling me to be careful, to avoid people if I can, to bathe myself in lysol afterwards, etc.  
I went to the gym on Monday and same thing, I'm seeing my friends tomorrow for the first time since March of last year and again, same thing.  
However he still goes to work and saw my brother (who is an antivaxer) the other day with no mask so I'm like ?  


Anyone else in the same position?
## Comment #12


Just saw Biden tweet about a delta variant? What the heck is this now?

Curious about what this means for everyone (not just the vaccinated) as I have a young child etc.
## Comment #13


How much more infectious can Covid get? With the exception of the vaccines, it feels like this just gets worse and worse
## Comment #14


I had a nightmare last night that there was a variant that could beat all of our vaccines so far and we would all have to go into lockdown again, is this possible or even likely?
## Comment #15


Considering that we can easily train dogs to sniff out people with covid, why are all airports not doing this? It seems practical and effective to me.
## Comment #16


Currently living in a country where I wont be and to get vaccinated until around October or November. Thinking about visiting another country and getting vaccinated while I'm there. 

If I get the J&J vaccine and then several months later I'm able to get vaccinated where I live, woulf it be dangerous to get that as well? Basically, are there any studies or information on getting two different vaccines if spaced apart some?

Another option, but I'm not sure yet. I could get 1st dose of phizer, and then after several months get the second in a different country. I assume that wouldn't be a problem since it's all the same, right?

**Study Description:** The Center for Innovation seeks to utilize this unique moment in history to study issues related to public information integrity and trust, along with access to medical needs and opportunistic industry behaviors in a pandemic. This research is designed to analyze the events and ultimately provide lessons that can strengthen both governmental responses and the institutions responsible for public health and safety. In particular, commentators are suggesting that economic, social, and political characteristics of the nation may change substantially as a result of Covid-19. This study seeks to create effective recommendations for policymakers as these changes occur. Previous studies have documented the important role of trust in institutions when attempting to translate institutional policy into ground level action, and this study seeks to expand and build on this work through surveys examining micro levels of trust in various institutions and public health responses. This research will then seek to place this micro data into the context of institutional responses to the pandemic. **Anyone living in the United States who has reached the age of majority can participate in this study.

**Study Title:** COVID-Cog: Cognitive Outcomes after COVID-19 Infection

**Study Description:** There is an urgent need to understand the neurocognitive impact of COVID-19. As there are millions of people globally surviving COVID-19 there are key questions remain: does COVID-19 infection result in significant cognitive impairment? Is the burden of cognitive impairment greater in those who require ICU stay vs. those hospitalized outside the ICU vs. those in the community?  And are there interactions with sex, age and medical risk factors that result in greater impact in some populations? To answer these questions, we need thousands of people from around the world, who have tested positive at some point for COVID-19, to participate in our study. The study itself consists of a survey that asks questions about COVID history, demographics, lifestyle, and general health, followed by a series of online games that measure different aspects of cognitive functioning; altogether, this takes less than 1 hour. We will also invite participants to complete the study again after 3 and 12 months, to examine how COVID-related impacts on cognition and general health change over time. **Individuals who have had a confirmed positive test for COVID-19, are over 18 years of age, and are fluent in English, French, or Spanish are invited to participate.**

**Study Title:** Coronagenes – An international population cohort to investigate genetic susceptibility to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)

**Study Description:** Data from popular home genetic-testing kits could help scientists shed light on why some people who catch coronavirus have no symptoms while others become very ill. **Researchers are asking people from around the world who have used DNA testing services – such as Ancestry DNA, FTDNA and 23andMe – to gain ancestry or health insights to join a study that aims to identify key genes involved in the body’s response to the infection.**

Understanding the effect genes have on susceptibility to Covid-19 could aid efforts to tackle the pandemic, and help combat future disease outbreaks, researchers say. More than 30 million people worldwide have used genetic testing services. Researchers are urging them to share their DNA data to help speed up discoveries that could help fight the virus.

By providing these data, volunteers will help the team avoid the costly, time-consuming task of collecting the hundreds of thousands of DNA samples that would otherwise be needed to map the genes involved. Volunteers who have not used these services will also be able to provide the project with DNA, once current lockdown restrictions have been eased.

The team aims to identify genes that influence the risk of developing Covid-19 and those that affect disease severity, by comparing volunteers’ symptoms – or lack of them – with their DNA.

Those taking part in the University of Edinburgh study – called Coronagenes – will complete online questionnaires about their health, lifestyle and any symptoms they have experienced, such as fever or a persistent cough.

Updating the survey before, during and after an infection will help scientists detect any patterns that might indicate how the virus progresses.

Researchers also aim to analyse the long-term health consequences of infection and self-isolation.

**Study Title:** Understanding the Impact of COVID-19 on Sleep and Mood: Online Study

**Study Description:** While there was a necessary initial focus on physical health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is becoming increasingly clear that many have experienced significant social and mental health repercussions as well. Investigators at Boston College initiated a daily survey study in mid-March to better understand the impacts of COVID-19 and the culture of living though a pandemic. They hope to not only reveal new information about potential risk and protective factors regarding COVID-19, but also hope to better understand how many of the large-scale measures being taken will impact us as individuals and a society. **We are seeking all adults (18+) regardless of whether they have been diagnosed with COVID-19.** With over 1,900 individuals already enrolled in the study with representation from 60 different countries across 6 continents and 20 different time zones, we are re-opening enrollment for continued assessments to get as comprehensive and diverse a look as we can at the global impact of COVID19 on sleep, mental health, and well-being.

**Study Description:** The world is suffering from a pandemic called COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The different national governments have problems evaluating the reach of the epidemic, having limited resources and tests to their disposal. Hence, any means to monitor the number of persons with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 with reasonable level of accuracy is useful. The objective of this study is the collection and publication of data concerning the number of people that show symptoms compatible with COVID-19 in different countries. This data is useful to estimate the number of infected persons with the COVID-19 virus at a given point in time in these countries, and the evolution of this number over time, using techniques like the Network Scale-up Method.

**Anyone 18+ worldwide can participate** in the study by filling the anonymous survey with indirect reporting.

**Study Description:** Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may be potentially vulnerable to the effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We are conducting a national study on the impact of the coronavirus on children with autism spectrum disorder and their families, with a particular interest in demographics and diversity. Broadly, we want to track the development of children with autism throughout the quarantine period of the pandemic, and learn about the emotional wellbeing and structure of the family during this time. Results from this study are hoped to help clinicians and practitioners improve treatments and services over time, supporting educational, behavioral, and social health in both children with autism and their families. Having a greater understanding of the development of children with autism following a pandemic should benefit care and enhance success in meeting the needs of these patients and their surrounding community.

**This study might be a good fit if you:**

• are over the age of 18-years-old;

• have a child with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) between the ages of 3- and 10-years-old;

**Study Description:** The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and the effect of COVID-19 on the microbiome (the microorganisms that live in and on the human body) in exposed household contacts of COVID-19. Exposed household contacts (EHC) are people who live with someone with COVID-19  and therefore have an increased chance of contracting the virus. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, meaning subjects will be randomly assigned to receive LGG or a placebo (an inactive substance given in the same form as the active substance) and will not know which product they are receiving. Participation in this study entails taking LGG/placebo for 28 days, responding to questionnaires, and providing stool and nasal swab samples. 

**To participate, individuals must be asymptomatic, at least 1 year old, live with a household contact who has tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within the previous 3 days, and be willing to stop taking any current probiotics/not take any other probiotics while on the study.**

Let’s go Vermont!
## Comment #3


It's been fun to see Vermont in the news so much in a good way the last few years. Before Bernie ran, I think most of the country probably just thought of us as cold and maybe part of Canada. Now we're known for being cold, actually part of the US in name if not in sentiment, filled with craaaaazy socialists, and CRUSHING COVID! 

If anyone's interested in visiting, we also have really good cheese, craft beer, and scenic views. But please, please, PLEASE don't move here for a while because the pandemic refugees have caused housing prices to fucking skyrocket and no locals can afford to buy. And jobs here aren't exactly plentiful or lucrative.
## Comment #4


I don’t understand. What is the perfect storm that gave Vermont the lead?

I’m a Vermonter and am getting my 2nd dose in the morning. LETS GO.

Wait to go Vermont and this is the proper way how to do herd immunity. If one cross the border into Quebec they're doing the mixed vaccine strategy called Prime boost.  The state of Vermont can do if the federal government Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control Food and Drug Administration and National Institutes of Health infectious diseases approves that strategy.

I'm glad VT is so progressive!  I have a "friend" that lives there.  She is not progressive.  She has babbled on and on during the pandemic that covid is a hoax, she's anti mask, and anti vaccine.  She's also cult level religious.  She is constantly saying to look at what is happening in VT as if it proves all her stupid points.

Loving these clear and public goals on the path to full reopening ive been seeing over the past few days. I really think this kind of messaging would have helped with some of the trepidation around covid restrictions, even if those goals were case numbers that were not going to be achieved until now or even later, having some number, some real life goal to look forward to would have helped alot. The ambiguous messaging on how long lickdowns would go for fueled alot of the conspiracy fires and imo brought people who were on the fence over to the conspiracy side of things.

Luckily Pfizer makes a fix for that as well.
## Comment #3


Literally happened to me. Wasn’t just blood flow to the shaft, my balls were affected. Testosterone dropped way off, had no interest in sex for the first time since puberty, 15 years ago, for over two weeks. Inability to maintain full hardness, even with porno and time. Actual sexual encounters with GF were even worse, because of performance anxiety. Almost had a mental breakdown. Had a dull ache on the shaft, above the balls but “within” my body, near that network of blood vessels, for the same period. I have recovered now, and everything works again, thank god, but I don’t know how long term fertility has been affected.  I’ll delete this in a few hours because it’s embarrassing but I’m sharing it in hopes of convincing even one partial skeptic. The vaccine was a lot less effort.
## Comment #4


Kind of even more messed up than not getting a free vaccine is the idea that vaccine hesitant men might be swayed by the protective affect on their erections rather than the impact on their “organ damage in the lungs, kidneys and brain” or just you know the chance of death or causing someone else’s death from covid.

People who become ill with Covid-19 now are, “in most age groups, twice as likely to end up hospitalized as people who got the virus earlier in the course of the pandemic,” Dr. Delbridge said.

In Maryland, of those between the ages of 50 and 59 who contracted Covid-19 over the winter, about 8 percent were hospitalized, he said. From the end of April through the beginning of June, the hospitalization rate in that group was 19 percent.
## Comment #3


At this point, if you don't want Covid, just get vaccinated. It's that simple.
## Comment #4


"One way of limiting the spread is for those who are vaccinated to wear masks around those who are not, doctors say."

This seems backwards. The unvaccinated should be the people that are required to wear masks. Let them be the inconvenienced ones.
## Comment #5


The article points out that hospitalizations have increased 700% in the last two weeks in two areas with low vaccination. While factual, this is a misleading statistic to say the least. Hospitalizations in both places have, in the past 2 weeks, gone from 1 to 7. They intentionally chose the scary statistic… I do not doubt for a second that the overall statement that hospitalizations are increasing in areas with low vaccination rates is true (no shit), but why must our news organizations mislead the public in this way. I know this is common, but this is exactly how misinformation and disinformation spreads. Factual statements presented in a misleading way. Just my 2 cents.
## Comment #6


While true, the raw numbers are still significantly lower than at any time over the past year.

If it becomes an issue, it will become a self correcting problem.  Fence sitters will hurry to get a vaccine if large numbers become a reality.  No heavy handed measures needed to force vaccination.
## Comment #7


Shocked\_pilachu.jpg
## Comment #8


As more things open areas with poor vaccination rates are going to have a bad time.
## Comment #9


My feelings are that if you purposefully choose to not get the vaccine even though you’re able to, then I have no sympathy for whatever happens to you if you contract COVID-19. 🤷🏻‍♀️
## Comment #10


Everyone predicted this. We all knew some unvaccinated people would stop wearing masks and start infecting each other.

If they wouldn’t listen, they wouldn’t get vaccinated and they were going to be infected.

Any ideas on how to get my antivax family to change their minds? I'm desperate at this point. Their latest conspiracy is that the vaccine is going to kill them in 4 years. We literally had a phonecall where they were crying after learning that I got it. I refuse to see them until they're vaccinated. Any thoughts or discussion points would be helpful, thanks.
## Comment #16


Autumn is going to be really hard on these people.
## Comment #17


And it is guaranteed to continue getting worse now that we're seeing US vaccination rates flattening out at 52%, restrictions easing, and more virulent strains propagating.

That remaining 48% in effect leaves a population in the US roughly 6x the size of Canada taking no precautions with fifteen thousand new infections/day still occurring ([https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html)) . Consider crowded markets, concerts, packed bars, etc now opening with increasing frequency.

I don't understand why everyones getting so sweaty over people not wanting a vaccine. If you got your shot your good right? I've known a few friends who both did and didn't get the vaxx and they all got sick from covid pretty bad and spread it to people around them.

Why isn't this just a case of I got mine people can do whatever they want. Even if the vaxx made it impossible to get covid or die surely thats on each person responsible for whether they do or don't.

I am acctually asking for anyone to reply and explain this to me. If I got the shot why do I care who didn't?

I wouldn't want any of these 178 anywhere near me at this hospital - even if they now get the shot. If you have to be threatened with being fired before you keep your patient's (and your own, FFS!) health in mind, you don't need to be working in a hospital.

As others have alluded to, there's more to this than politics.  Take Michigan as an example. Michigan would be doing much better if Detroit's vaccination rate were better (currently 36%). Whereas nearby Oakland county, which has been heavily Republican for the last 30yrs, is closing in on 70%.  Heck, Wayne County (where Detroit is) is at over 60% (with Detroit removed as it's a separate reporting entity).  So clearly it's not all politics.  In this case it's race, education, income, etc.  And this is with a mass vaccination site in downtown Detroit at Ford Field.

Edit: I should have read more than the first half.  The second half of the article goes into some of this.

The difference between the way the parties treat their members described: 

Trump got the vaccination in private and won't talk about it, while encouraging conspiracy theories that put his followers at risk by not getting vaccinated. 

Biden got his shot in public and aggressively encourages everyone to get it as well.

The country is not divided by politics. It's divided by intellect.
## Comment #6


Nah bro, both sides are equally to blame for our problems.
 
I am very intelligent.
## Comment #7


Of course there is when these hillybilly rednecks refuse the vaccine.........this is news?
## Comment #8


So half of Republicans, 61 percent of independents and 88 percent of Democrats are vaccinated yet barely more than 50 percent of the population is vaccinated?  It sounds like people might be lying or the sample is not representative of the overall picture.

I mean we all know this is true, one party is just way less intelligent - the nicest way I can say this.
## Comment #11


Serious question, how is this article allowed on this sub?  Auto moderator nukes anything that even mentions the president's name.
## Comment #12


This isn’t hard to believe.
## Comment #13


Ok. This is going to come out badly... So apologies in advance...

Unvaccinated people are much more likely get coronavirus.  A small percentage of them will die from it....

So does that mean that the democrats will take over those states because of the declining republican population?
## Comment #14


All that that nice plot shows me is that GA, NV, AZ, WI, and MI all  actually voted for Trump.

Well then, COVID will slowly kill off the GOP.

Pretty simple really.  Get vaccinated or risk potential serious injury and or death.

Wife is an NP.  Patients dying with Covid 19, in their last breaths saying "I don't have Covid..."

Viruses don't care of you are Democrat, Republican or Libertarian... it's just looking for another host - to destroy.

When will Canada allow fully vaccinated tourists from the EU?

Why only Canadians? Why does the country of origin matter for fully vaccinated people?

Try bundling the vaccine with a $50 coupon to Walmart.
## Comment #2


Well no shit with how apeshit the anti-vaxxers have gone about avoiding it.

I think we all know who would be refusing to vaccinate.

Stimulus checks incoming?

Thanks Mississippi  ! /s
## Comment #6


Yeah, when he made the goal it was pretty unlikely if you looked at the statistics.  Unless he was going to have some very good plans or incentives the math just wasn't checking out.  We needed to maintain the daily average from a month ago and at that time it was declining 10% week to week and increasing in the rate of decline.    
Oh well....good on him for having a stretch goal.  No more softballs.
## Comment #7


A bit of a bummer, but it is encouraging that we are probably going to get there at some point this summer. Keep in mind that most polling typically shows ~60% of American adults dead set on getting vaccinated, meaning that basically every new 18+ who gets a shot now is someone who was previously at least somewhat skeptical of getting a shot.
## Comment #8


But this subreddit assured me that the "masks off if you're vaccinated" guidance would cause more people to get vaccinated, not that it would remove any incentive that anti-mask and anti-vaxx people had to even acknowledge that COVID exists.
## Comment #9


It's not a functional goal really.  There's nothing specific to July 4 or 70%.  Biden or his team did nothing targeting this specific result.  So it's really a prediction and publication of it would have been ammunition for re-election talking points.  Except they probably won't meet it -- oops.  Not their fault...we live in a free society where freedom includes the right to be stupid without government interference.  Many or most of the refusers will likely be added to the "herd" through natural means.  Unfortunately also resulting in collateral damage.  So we don't live in a perfect world -- who knew?
## Comment #10


Big ole shrug. 66 or 67 percent is fine.
## Comment #11


You can take a horse to water. You can't force it to drink.
## Comment #12


its not a lack of vaccine. people just dont want it. let them get sick then?
## Comment #13


70%? 60% might already be difficult!
