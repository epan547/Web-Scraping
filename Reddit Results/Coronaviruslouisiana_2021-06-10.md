## Comment #2


Makes me sick to my stomach to see how many sheep there are.

#Analysis Pt 1
- *Ya'll today's data report is all types of messed up. 
    * 34% of parishes are reporting fewer cumulative cases and tests than were reported yesterday.
        * For instance, Orleans is reporting -66 new cases off of -10,784 tests.  
    * Because of the daily removal of newly identified duplicates and out-of-state cases, the new case increase may not match the difference between today’s and yesterday's total case count.
- Testing Information
    * Collection Dates: 100% falls between June 1 and June 7, 2021.
    * Community Spread: 98%
    * Congregate Spread: 2%
    * Age Breakdown: 
        * 18-39: 53%
            * 30-39: 20%
            * 18-29: 23%
- **Hospitalization has increased by +11 for a total of 295 COVID19+ patients hospitalized in Louisiana. This is an increase by +9 or 3.1% over the last 7 days, +28 or 10.5% over the last 14 days, -40 or -12% when compared to 5/8/21.
    * ICU Capacity
        * *This is no longer being tracked by the LDH.
