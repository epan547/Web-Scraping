## Comment #2


Searching for a PS5 last fall has prepared me for the vaccine battle ahead
## Comment #3


<mark>Just ranting - but I feel like every non-priority, 25-40 yr old friend of mine that lives out of state has received their vaccine already. Their counties are doing mass vaccination clinics and calling up whomever is on their wait list to come and get their shots.</mark>

There has to be a better/more efficient way than whatever it is we're trying to do.

End rant. Thanks for making it this far.
## Comment #4


Do you have to be a resident of a county to get a vaccine there?  

If county next to yours gets to your tier first, can you just get a vaccine there?
## Comment #5


3 days ago Kaiser sent an email out saying that they

* Provide coverage for 9.3 million Californians.  (roughly 25% of the population of CA)
* Have received 300k doses of vaccines (roughly 9% of the 3.5 million doses administered in CA)

What could possibly be causing this disconnect?  Where are all the doses going?
## Comment #6


So is Phase 1B Tier 2 just not a thing anymore with the age-based priority? I’ve been doing gig-app food delivery on the side and was hoping to qualify.

After the age based prioritization news a few weeks back, I’m confused because California then doubled back and prioritized those with disabilities or co-morbidities.

Anyone know if gig workers/transportation workers will also be re-prioritized or are we all just in the dark?
## Comment #7


I was vaccinated today with a self attestation letter. I sometimes work at my brother in laws restaurant, so I was able to to get it. After hearing how vaccination sites barely ask you your name I was surprised that they asked me not once, but twice, for proof and even quizzed me asking *where* I worked as if I didn't write the letter myself. They kept the letter, which kinda bugs me because I hate having my name and signature out there. I have zero clue what they'll do with it. I half wonder if they forgot to give it back to me. Who knows. I'm glad to have gotten the 1st of 2 pfizer shots.
## Comment #8


<mark>I work in healthcare and I and the staff each went to get our first dose on our own.  One staff member was immediately signed up for a second dose appointment but nobody else got offered that.  We all just assumed we would have to go through the signup process again... but at this point it's looking like getting appointments are nearly impossible.  Are we supposed to just go through the same channel to get our 2nd dose?  Seems impossible, all appointments around here filled up already for the dates around 4 wks past the first dose.  Kind of at a loss as to what to do.</mark>
## Comment #9


This would be a lot more efficient and less waste if there were 2 categories. The Age category and then the backup category. Let the people who want the vaccine, get the vaccine. California stop requiring letters from employers, badges, etc. Give the elders priority but also make the vaccine available to those who want it. Stop being strict. There is a new President now that will forgive the breaking of harsh rules set by the former President.
## Comment #10


<mark>Allocation just seems to be a mess.  I've been hunting thru the state to see where doses are available.  I consistently see over 100 first dose appointments in the next 2 days available with Walgreens within 20 miles of Bakersfield.  Yet nothing in Orange or LA Counties.  Let's get those vaccines to places where people actually want them!</mark>
## Comment #11


Any reason why our rate of vaccinations has slowed? Our 7 day average has again dropped below 200k.
## Comment #12


Does anyone know if we will be able to book appointments for when we become eligible before our eligibility date? For example, finding an appointment for the 15th on the 13th
## Comment #13


Hello,

I have created a simple web app, [Vaccine Pickle](https://vp.d35zanfa4rowy2.amplifyapp.com/), that notifies you when there is a vaccine appointment available in your area. You provide the zip code and radius and Vaccine Pickle will email you whenever there is availability in your area. Vaccine Pickle currently offers CVS, Rite-Aid, Walmart, Walgreens, ACME, Duane Reed, Safeway, Albertsons, Harris Teeter, and many more. We will continue to work on adding more distributors!. I really hope this can help make the process easier! Feel free to share it with those who would be interested in this. Please share any feedback or concerns with me I will get back to you. Hopefully, it helps!

Cheers
## Comment #14


Looked for an appointment yesterday. Easily Found an appointment for noon the next day in Rancho Cucamonga CVS. Most of the times looked open. Went in today and was done in about 30 minutes . Much easier than I had feared !
## Comment #15


Why does the MyTurn page keep directing me to Safeway when they don't have any available appointments? Like every single search I do all it shows is Safeway.

## Comment #17


I got my Kaiser vaccine email invitation yesterday and my first dose that same afternoon in Folsom, CA. I just indicated that I have a pre-existing condition on the MyTurn (mild COPD not on oxygen). Others in line around me had asthma and one was a cancer survivor.

Also, staff came out from time to time to offer the J&J single dose to anyone who wanted it, giving them the ability to jump the line and get it right away. Some went for it but most stayed and waited for the Pfizer dose. Just my observations.
## Comment #18


So I just got my first dose on Friday. I’m 27 in the food & agriculture group.

Happy to get the moderna at a rite aid near me in the Bay Area but something stuck out to me.

My appointment was for 2, I received my vaccine at 3:30PM. Happy to wait as I had the luxury to do so and I’m not sure if this is just a problem of this locations rite aid but as I waited in the pharmacy just 2 vaccines were given before me. Had to wait 90 minutes because the pharmacy was understaffed with just 2 people working and receiving constant phone calls, pick ups. Not their fault. However 3 vaccines given in 90 minutes with the 15min observation period turning into a 30min observation to receive my card due to short staffing led me to have serious concerns.

A lot of people work and would be counting on their break to get the vaccine, a lot of people can’t wait 90mins. If it was another day, I think I would have had to leave possibly to get back to work.

I know we have a shit tier system and a lot of people need their shot and are more well deserving than my 27 year old ass. However, I don’t know if it’s just this location of Rite Aid being understaffed.. I can’t help but think the process in place at a lot of pharmacies isn’t ready for the upcoming supply and everyone booking appointments at this pace if this location is indicative of pharmacy short staffing elsewhere.
## Comment #19


Souther California Kaiser seems to have finally begun to vaccinate the over 75 crowd. My mother got a call from them the other day.

My mom already got her first at the county site. Second shot is next week.
## Comment #20


I have some 20 year old state worker friends likely WFH in IT/Engineering that got the vaccine. Looks like government favoritism
## Comment #21


Hey, all.. just got my first dose (food service worker) at CVS. Highly recommend checking CVS for doses! I’ve heard that the state-run sites run out fast, but private businesses like Walgreens and CVS aren’t as busy so they have more doses available.
## Comment #22


LA, they're out  right now, but I was able to get an appointment faster than through the county website.

https://carbonhealth.com/covid-19-vaccines
## Comment #23


So, even though I work for the Department of Defense and Energy, and was in Group 1C, it seems that I have been bumped to Group 2. I also have asthma, but that doesn’t seem to be a qualifying conditions.

I’m assuming that I may be able to get a vaccine in December.
## Comment #24


[deleted]
## Comment #25


Hi does anyone know what kind of vaccine Walgreens offers? I made an appointment and saw someone mention Pfizer but I wasn’t able to find an official statement from Walgreens
## Comment #26


Wondering if the next tier will be just age-based? I worry about my dad. He is about to turn 61 and has had pneumonia so many times. He doesn't have any of the listed high-risk conditions, but is just not the healthiest guy (on blood pressure meds, slightly overweight).
## Comment #27


Is it just me, or has CVS not updated its eligibility requirements with today's new standards? I'd love to try to get an appointment via CVS (they tend to refresh spots at 12 AM when I'm conveniently still awake) but only if they will let me through!
## Comment #28


Does anyone know if someone can book their appointment now for a date after April 15th once everybody's eligible?
## Comment #29


Post should mention that 50+ are now eligible (starting April 1st) and 16+ will be eligible starting April 15th.
## Comment #30


Man I am getting really tired of Anti-vax logic seriously losing friends over this

## Comment #33


MyTurn has updated its eligibility screen to ask whether you have an underlying condition.
## Comment #34


Hey guys. Going to be getting 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine soon. I’ve heard the side effects can be pretty brutal i.e. flu like symptoms, headaches, nausea for the entirety of the day. Is there any way to minimize these effects? Thanks in advance.
## Comment #35


Two Q’s:
1. I deliver groceries with Instacart on the weekends, does this qualify me as food & agriculture?
2. Anyone know of places in central SD city doing the J&J shot? I know we’re not supposed to vaccine shop, but I also know I’m forgetful and might not remember to make a second dose appointment.
## Comment #36


Is phase 1C still a thing? If yes, when can we expect it to open up?
## Comment #37


Currently available (as of April 4th, 3:30pm) vaccines at sites run by Curative. Note that each site has its own, often unique, eligibility criteria. Also, for whatever reason, the Curative website search doesn't find any vaccine sites. I dont know why, but the nice people on the ground want people to know they have appointments available.

Just an FYI for anyone in San Bernardino county there are tons of appointments in San Bernardino county but you have to do it through the county's own website, not through myturn. I scored a pfizer appointment for next week.

Do we know how March 15th will work? I’m in my 20’s but meet at least one of the comorbid conditions under the March 15 eligibility group. My doctor hadn’t heard of this when I asked last week, and said it vaccination was being handled by the medical group. If I make an appointment at a pharmacy for March 15th would I be able to get it?

Any news on J & J getting more vaccines shipped to LA county? I became eligible because I have Type 2 Diabetes but read that the country was not getting any new diesel for at least two weeks. Hoping to squeeze in my vaccination before the 50 and over crowd is allowed to get the shot on April 1st.
## Comment #52


If you have Kaiser you can book an appointment online or through their app. They are not asking for ages or anything, just agree to the essential worker and if you’re in the age group they are giving shots to...they don’t check at the site

I am essential but not food or anything, got my shot on Saturday at CalState Long Beach

It’s free

The line was fast, too, got the shot in less than 20 minutes after registration, then the 15 min wait

They’re giving the Moderna one there

Got my 2nd appointment scheduled at the same time

I booked an appointment for my husband as well for next week, tons of openings for April

I’m 62 but have 3 medical conditions that make me high risk. Going by age alone I think I’m tier 1c. Is there a way for high risk people to get the vaccine faster? I can’t find any info on this situation.
## Comment #58


Hi Guys, I created a script to check vaccine appointment availability on myturn.gov.ca website.  This script will save trouble to folks who are constantly refreshing/re-entering information to check if any slots are available. (i.e. this script will NOT magically find a slot for you if you are not eligible). This just automates the form filling without launching a browser. some basic coding skills required.  Code is released under GPL V3.  [https://github.com/carefulcomputer/myturn-covid-vaccine](https://github.com/carefulcomputer/myturn-covid-vaccine)

I have a vaccine eligibility question. I’m a current Ph.D. student employed as a “graduate assistant” for my on-campus research. Our school hasn’t addressed eligibility aside from saying “university employees” are included as “education workers.” Am I now eligible as of today (March 1st)?
## Comment #68


I volunteer part time at an assisted living location (serve lunches, play games etc) and was able to schedule my vaccine at CVS pretty easily.  I don't get paid or anything.  I hope a letter from the business owner will suffice as proof.

Wish me luck!
## Comment #69


nobody in bay area has vaccines. closest place was Sacramento or Modesto.
## Comment #70


I’m an essential worker and work for a contractor that maintains public transit equipment.  I know I was supposed to be eligible under the old plan along with “transportation and logistics,” and even had my letter ready, but I’m wondering if they still might accept it?  It seems like they might only be doing people who actually work for BART or LADOT or whatever in this new phase, but it’s kind of vague and I don’t know how strict the guidelines are for proof of eligibility in different industries.
## Comment #71


Trying to sign my high risk parents up for vaccination but I cannot find a single appointment anywhere within 30 miles of us
## Comment #72


I know this is probably going to be controversial, but hopefully people understand.

My mom does not live in this country but has come to help us out with our kids. She’s staying (legally) for 6 months, potentially longer. Anyone know if there is an explicit pollicy in terms of if such people could be vaccinated? (She’s over 65)
## Comment #73


what happens if you lose the piece of paper for vaccination record? how do you get a new copy?
## Comment #74


Does anyone have any idea when law firm staff will be eligible? I’ve been working with my firm’s skeleton crew and because I do lower level admin work, it can’t be done from home and I’ve been working in person the entire time.

I’ve been classified an essential worker but under the government and infrastructure tier. I don’t routinely interact with the general public, but we still have clients.

Do you need to be a resident in a given county to get the vaccine at a CVS/Walgreens/etc?
## Comment #78


Has anyone gotten the Johnson and Johnson vaccine? I can't seem to find it anywhere. I would much prefer a single dose over others just so I don't have to worry about making two appointments. I'm I'm SoCal, willing to drive
## Comment #79


I'm as unhappy about my school shutting down as the next person. But I agree with the "safety first" principle, and understand the need to shut down schools in the wake of an incoming surge. (There are other industries that need to shut down as well, but that's a topic for another day.)

Honestly, given Pfizer and J&J's unexpected success in testing vaccines for children, we should wait until vaccines are available for students *and* teachers to return to in-person instruction. Or at the *very least*, wait until that point to remove social distancing and mask mandates. Honestly, I don't even mind waiting until halfway through the semester to do so.
## Comment #80


Got my first dose today at Kaiser. They gave me a date to come back but KP.org shows no appointment scheduled. Do I need to go online to schedule a new appt or just walk in at any time?? They just slapped a sticker on my vaccine card that says "05/10/21" with no time written
## Comment #81


Fresno City College has drive-up/walk-up vaccination.  NO appointment necessary.  https://www.fresno.ucsf.edu/cep/  

Today, the line was short and even NO LINE at all!  

If you don't mind a long drive, go to Fresno, get vaccinated, then go have lunch, and drive back home.

That's out of date.  J&J was paused on April 13th and resumed on April 23rd.

Currently at the Oakland Coliseum  mega site for my teacher husband's round 1 shot! They have a lot of open appointments for tiers 1A and 1B, and you schedule your 1st and 2nd appointments up front. I tagged along and asked about a "waitlist" or end of day extras and was told "I wish." Worth a try! Everything  is very organized, all drive through, lines stay constantly moving. If you're in Northern CA you can make an apt here I believe, on myturn.
## Comment #92


OAKLAND: If you live in east and are eligible, call 211 and you might be able to snag an appointment, possibly even same day. They are prioritizing getting vaccines for east Oakland zip codes (you'll probably need some kind of ID to verify, of course).
## Comment #93


Just want to correct the info for Marin County and let you know that only 1A and residents 65+ are being vaccinated at this time, not the rest of the 1B tier (I’m a teacher and still waiting). Our county has a lot of older people so I’m going to be waiting a while, unfortunately.
## Comment #94


Does anyone know the difference between MyTurn and CalVax? Some providers are doing sign-ups through MyTurn and some through CalVax. I like the interface of CalVax because it shows you how many appointments are available at each time slot but there's no way to search for clinics and times. MyTurn allows you to search for clinics but not all of them are on there. Are they going to be consolidated?

Question: is there anywhere in the state of California that actually needs volunteers? I tried Santa Barbara, San Francisco, San Jose, Los Angeles and Riverside. I guess since rolling out this new program, they got too many volunteers, which makes sense.

It just feels like it's taking an eternity for them to get through the tiers. Heck, they're baaaaarely in Tier 1, Phase 1B. At this rate, it may be 2023 by the time everyone (down to the youngest kids) are eligible for vaccines. Am I being impatient? Absolutely. Do I need to chill out? Probably. I guess I'm just a little frustrated with the slow pace.

Is one shot enough protection? I know it's only 50% immunity, but what does that actually mean? Should I stop worrying about covid after I get the first shot, or should I be equally worried as before?

After I get the second shot, how long until I don't have to worry about covid at all? Two weeks is the cutoff date for that, but can it be sooner?

## Comment #121


Has anyone had an issue with the myTurn website, where they can schedule the first dose, and then when it comes time to choose the second dose, that date just is blank where available appointments should be? Seems like each time I make more progress on this website it's literally 1 click further than I went before...

edit: Yep, now all the slots are gone. How is it possible for anyone to get an appointment on this website, if it is either broken all the time, or when it's not, the appointments for the next week are snapped up in minutes? What is even the point of the tier system if the system only schedules a week out? Some states schedule 6-8 weeks out, which is a long time to wait, but with this system you could literally try for 6-8 weeks and not get an appointment time.

The most extreme example of this would be to update the website with only 1 extra appointment time at any random time. Then, unless you were literally the last person to want to get vaccinated in CA, you would never be guaranteed an appointment.

I have a question about eligibility at CVS - wondering how strict they are with the quality of your proof?

I have an appointment for a vaccine this weekend but I work in private childcare and my only proof will be a handwritten note from my employer.

This might be a silly question but my dad just made me paranoid — So I got my second Pfizer dose at CVS today but what are the chances that they messed up and administered the Moderna vaccine instead?!

Is it easy to book a second dose appointment? I live in WA but am moving to CA at the end of April. I'd rather get vaccinated sooner which means getting the first dose in Washington.

When went to pharmacy, there is obviously data taken when you get the vaccine. What is the nature of access and sharing of this data and personal information between the big pharmacy, the CDC, the California Health Department, and LA county?

I'm also considering signing up for a volunteer shift. I realize some vaccination sites won't verify my eligibility but I don't want to lie when scheduling an appointment for myself.

Walgreens seems to not be asking for anything than being a frontline worker now in SoCal. I signed up as a teacher in LA, because I work there and live in OC. Give them a try early in the morning.

So myturn has already updated eligibility for the additional sectors of workers for Los Angeles County. Does anyone know if others, like the LA City Fire department sites, will update March 1st?

I work part-time taking care of a few senior citizens. I shop for them, take them to dr. appointments, etc. does this qualify as anything current or upcoming for the vaccination?

Thanks
## Comment #164


Will I be eligible for a vaccine in March if I am a TEACHER, but got laid off last summer due to covid??? Wouldn't that be poetic injustice...

I have an active state teaching credential, an old employee badge, a handful of pay stubs for single day guest-lecturing work I am doing but... I am NOT an active employee!

This is specific for some Alameda County residents, but anyone 16+ can make an appointment now for certain ZIP codes (Hayward, San Leandro, San Lorenzo, and Oakland.)

If I'm a realtor what phase does that put me in? I know it's considered essential work but I'm not sure if that brings me closer to the vaccine. I'm in riverside county is that helps
## Comment #169


So I know I’m not 65 but some how I got an appointment for the vaccine on the 20th and I’m only 35 so I know they are going to turn me away so anyone my age or older have gotten turned away

So it seems clear they're intent on aligning with the CDC. If they vote on June 17 to remove masks, what's the point of waiting one more week? It's not like they're going to cite anyone during that week. I suppose maybe large chain stores will comply but most others won't.

This appears to be the letter from State Health Officer Dr. Tomás J. Aragón to Cal-OSHA mentioned in the article:

https://www.dir.ca.gov/oshsb/documents/CDPH-Letter.pdf

> .. as of June 15, face coverings will no longer be required for fully
vaccinated Californians in public settings, except in the settings where CDC
advises that all individuals should wear face coverings regardless of vaccination
status, such as healthcare settings and long-term care facilities, public transit,
and sheltering operations. Accordingly, CDPH will align its face coverings
guidance with the CDC by requiring face coverings for all individuals in those
unique settings.

> ... CDPH will align its face coverings guidance with the CDC by requiring face coverings for all unvaccinated individuals in indoor public settings and businesses.

> In settings where masks are required only for unvaccinated individuals, CDPH’s guidance will advise that businesses may choose to allow individuals to self attest their vaccine status, implement vaccine verification measures, or require all patrons to wear masks. Further, CDPH will affirm that no person can be prevented from wearing a mask as a condition of participation in an activity or entry into a business.

(edit: cleaned up)
## Comment #3


Just make them optional. If you want to continue wearing them, then do. If you don’t, then don’t.
## Comment #4


In what sense?
## Comment #5


Meeting agenda: https://www.dir.ca.gov/oshsb/documents/agendaJun092021.pdf

It will start at 5pm today.

> The purpose of the Special Meeting is for the Board to consider new information from
the California Department of Public Health on pending guidance regarding COVID-19
Prevention, and take action if appropriate.
## Comment #6


I work for a “doctor” and she straight out told me we don’t have to mandate masks anymore once June 15th hits. (I had to fight her to even mandate them in the first place, so I’m not surprised.) I’m double vaccinated so I should be ok.

Edit: she’s a naturopath, not an MD
## Comment #7


They reversed their vote from June 3rd.

There will be a new draft tomorrow which they will vote on June 17th and will go in effect June 28th.

Those numbers are even out of date.

Well yeah, the way they describe how the winners are contacted sounds like an extended car warranty scam.
