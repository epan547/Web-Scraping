## Comment #1


I had a large tick on me. Pulled it off a little over 24 hours after being in the woods. It was difficult to remove. I pulled very hard. It left a tiny wound that scabbed over. But now there's a red rash a little bigger than a quarter. Yes I've been scratching it a little, but this is in the skin. Not sure if it's a mild infection or lyme. Skin is a little plump but not bad

I'm in Georgia so Lyme unlikely.

Not sure if this is the right place to post this but my llmd says these are bartonella striae, I was curious it anyone else has skin irregularities like this? I have two lines on one arm and one line on the other. https://imgur.com/a/p0DM2KJ/

I know these were tick bites as I was in an uninhabited grassy area 2-3 days ago and only just realised they were ticks today as some were still latched onto my leg. I removed them and they left these bumps. What should i do?

[tick?](https://ibb.co/1r5gtMQ)
It wasn’t original red, I’ve been trying with tweezers. I don’t *think* it’s a tick, but personally, I want to be *sure* it’s not one. I don’t see legs, but it’s definitely small either way. Can’t get it with tweezers, it’s almost like underneath the skin.
## Comment #6


I found a tick on me last night, I dont think it was there for too long but it dug itself in already and was sucking blood. The spot still kinda hurts but Im wondering if that goes away
## Comment #7


I feel like I’m probably just being paranoid but should I be worried about [this weird mark that appeared on my face](https://imgur.com/a/GA3GJhC)?

The red spot is flat-topped but slightly raised overall and feels a bit rough to the touch. The blanched is what’s making me kind of nervous since I’ve never had a rash where that happens before. Neither area is itchy/painful or flaking/oozing/open wound.

I don’t have any other symptoms and the rash doesn’t seem to be anywhere else on my body. I couldn’t get a tick bite on my cheek without noticing, right?

Any ideas what this could be and if I should go to a dermatologist?

Tick bite? We did a cleanup and one participant of 10 found a single tick

Hardly itches. No symptoms

Haven’t been in any wooded areas recently, and have not found any ticks on me or my family. Not sure what else this would be though.

https://imgur.com/a/vJV4iSs been out golfing. Had a bite and scratched the crap out of it. Now I'm wondering is this a tick bite or did I scratch a regular bug bite too much
## Comment #11


This suddenly appeared few hours ago. It doesn’t itch or anything. I did have headache for last 12 hours. Could it be tick? I did play volleyball yesterday, so hoping this is a bruise from that, but it is rather red for bruise. Thanks!

What do you think?

https://www.reddit.com/user/dexterrible/comments/noem5i/spiderdex_day_3_kinda_feels_softer_by_touch/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Been to ER right away I noticed it (last Friday), no pain, no fever, nothing I feel great as usual. I check myself for ticks usually when I go hiking, but didn’t notice anything initially this looked like a pimple, and next day or two it was itching so I took a look and to my suprise saw this.

ER suspected a spider bite reaction after examination , gave me a topic cream and told me to keep an eye on it and if it gets worse or I feel fever etc to come back.

So far, so good.

Btw, that same night I visited ER when I came back home very late at around 2 am in the morning I saw a pretty bit spider for Switzerland standards, near my
Bedroom on the ceiling.

Curious about your thoughts! Thanks
Edit, feel free to ask me more questions

Camping at sequoia in California. Saw a red dot at first but came home to this the next day. Itched a bit but not that much. Never saw a tick but looks like a white clearing but not sure if skin color is blocking the bullseye look.
What do you guys think?
# Rapid Lyme disease test - Genetic tests for Lyme!


Created: 2021-06-10 00:05:45

I found the interview between Lex Friedman and David Sinclair fascinating. David Sinclair is a researcher at Harvard who has been studying aging. In his comments though he mentioned his daughter getting Lyme disease and almost going blind.  When he asked the doctors when the test results would be done he was told it would take 4 days. This frustrated him and he asked if he could take a sample of the blood back with him so he could take it to his lab at Harvard to run a genetic sequence test on her blood to see if the sequencing would show if Lyme was there. He was refused unfortunately.  This got my interest though if research is being done on creating such a test and the answer is yes. They are testing now and it will show not only if you have Lyme, but if it is new or late stage Lyme infection.  Here is the article. https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-04-lyme-disease-distinguishes-early-late-stage.html

David mentioned that in the future you will probably just swab your mouth and send it to a lab and it will show all the viruses and bacteria in your system. It will also show hormone levels and many other stats that will give you an idea of how your body is doing.  Here is the interview. It starts slow but around 11 minutes in it gets very fascinating. https://youtu.be/jhKZIq3SlYE

I always listen to this podcast. When I heard the words Lyme disease my eyes became wide open and then he kept talking and said what you described. Makes me wish I had a real scientist/doctor looking at my illness.
# Sorry for disgusting pic, but did anyone elses lyme disease bite look like this? It was more purple at first. It's been there for over 5 years. Hard to get diagnosed in the UK.

# Advice for Doxy


Created: 2021-06-10 13:06:12

I was bit by a tick on Sunday or Monday. Didn’t seem to attach (swiped it off the back of my neck without thinking). I’ve got a small red rash with a bite mark. The doctor wasn’t messing about and has prescribed 100mg of Doxy x2 daily. She wanted 2 weeks, I pushed for 3. She was fine with that. Told me to go to the ER if the rash increased significantly and I started to feel very unwell. Saying I might need A/B intravenously if that happened. I forget the name of the A/B she said they would need to then use.

Does anyone have any advice on taking Doxy? I’ve seen it’s hard on your stomach. So ignore the on an empty stomach piece? And take a good probiotic in between doses? Don’t lie down afterwards or something weird? Any other advice on taking it?

I took it with a handful of food, just avoid dairy or calcium. In addition to your list, avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight until you know whether you are photosensitive.
# Gonna have to figure it out.....


Created: 2021-06-09 21:59:58

OURSELVES. What does Lyme do that makes us feel so shitty. Sometimes I feel those spirochetes burrowing into my bones and ligaments and I know they are there. But why all the other stuff. What does the bacteria take from us that makes us feel crappy. I once handed a letter to the wife of a HUGE USA Supplement Manufacturer and told him to make a LYME FORMULA to put back into our bodies , what the bacteria is taking out-all in ONE PILL(or a series of pills). Wonder if she gave it to him, he never wrote back. Come ON, what is it doing to us, how can we feel better??

## Comment #1


I highly suggest reading buhners book on Lyme he has so much info about cytokines,which cause most of our symptoms. I want to take a pic of a page where he explains exactly this...but I don't know how to upload it to Reddit
## Comment #2


Inflammation! Cytokine cascades! They are the bane of our existence.
## Comment #3


You're absolutely right. WE have to figure it out ourselves, and we are in this together! We need ADVOCACY and RESEARCH!
## Comment #4


Check out Steven Phillips on “blebbing.”
## Comment #5


Basically the break down of collagen and other structures by the spirochetes will generate fragments that our bodies respond to by producing localized inflammation in the form of cytokines.
## Comment #6


Nobody can explain it.  Nobody in the medical field wants to try and find a solution.  CDC is littered with false info.  Google “Operation Paperclip”.  Then google Plum Island and watch the YouTube video about the “testing” done.  That will help all that have Lyme with how it started at least.
## Comment #7


There isn't one reason, so there won't be one pill for everyone. [Treatlyme.net](https://www.treatlyme.net/lyme-disease-treatment-guidelines) has suggestions.
# Negative IgM Positive IgG in Late Untreated Lyme


Created: 2021-06-09 18:59:32

Late stage untreated Lyme. Trying to understand the negative IgM and positive IgG. Even in mainstream medicine, does a positive IgG conclusively indicate exposure to borrelia?

My IgG doesn't meet the CDC standard. It's positive for four (4) bands, not the five that the CDC requires. Specifically, I am positive for 23-25, 31, 41 and 58. This is positive according to Igenex, and negative according to the CDC.

However, is it correct to state that even the CDC / mainstream medicine would expect someone who was never exposed to Borrelia NOT to test positive in multiple bands under the IgG? Since I was never diagnosed and never treated for Lyme (first symptoms around 2008, live in a Lyme-endemic area, significant exposure from outdoor pursuits), is it uncontroversial to say that I was exposed to Borrelia?

Thanks in advance for your help!

## Comment #1


As far as the IDSA/CDC are concerned, they don't actually care whether you were exposed or not, or whether you actually have the infection or not.  They have their little crappy test and their ridiculous algorithm, and that's all that matters.  If you somehow manage to meet their criteria, they'll prescribe an arbitrary amount of doxycycline, which has never been shown to cure you, and send you on your way.
## Comment #2


You've probably had Lyme for over a decade, without treatment.

If you find yourself unhealthy, then you need to find a Lyme Doctor who will treat you.
## Comment #3


CDC is useless and in my opinion liars. After 30 years with this disease I will also say that most doctors are useless as well.
## Comment #4


CDC....  Bleep them.  What symptoms do you have?

Look into bee venom therapy. It’s the only thing that has been helping me and it’s doing wonders. And it’s dirt cheap, like $50 a month. Yes it hurts and isn’t pleasant, but compared to Lyme, it’s easy.

# Cutter Lyme Tick Test Kit?


Created: 2021-06-10 03:07:30

I saw this testing kit in my ads and was very curious. Searched on here and didn't see it mentioned (hope this isn't against the rules!) It looks like the comprehensive panel tests quite a few pathogens. Where I'm from on  the east coast I would occasionally pick 20 or more dog ticks off of me and my animals in a day so would go broke doing this but curious if anyone tried it. Both times I was infected I never saw the tick but deer tick are so darn tiny. Thoughts?

## Comment #1


I would use tick check. Tickcheck.com is probably their site I’m not sure tho. It’s a bit more expensive but tests for multiple diseases and they don’t charge extra for more than one tick.

# Duration of EM rash


Created: 2021-06-10 01:33:55

I asked my doc about a red circular splotch underneath my armpit, and he said to wait and see since I do daily tick checks, didn’t actually see a tick, and it was crazy itchy/I had c diff twice in 2016, so taking preventative antibiotics really messes my body up. It’s all but disappeared in less than 4 days. I will admit the shape of it had me spooked, but if it were Lyme, would the rash have faded so quickly? I’m new to living in the woods
TIA!

## Comment #1


The rash is inflammation of the dermis as the spirochetes head outward to disseminate throughout the body.  They move very fast, so the rash may clear up in a few days on it's own, usually expanding outward with central clearance.
