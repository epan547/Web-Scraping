# Any experience on (Intermittent) Fasting and Long Covid?

I did for about 8 weeks, but I saw more of a difference when I cut out refined sugar because I had less inflammation.

I have found daily intermittent fasting to benefit my digestive system and energy levels for sure. I want to try a longer fast, but I've been losing weight so badly I can't do it yet. There is a guy on facebook called Tom Bunker who has a page about fasting protocols. Many people seem to have benefitted. Maybe check him out?
