## Comment #1


Does anyone know what it takes to get a test?  I'm sick with symptoms that match but I'm uninsured.
## Comment #2


The numbers were just updated (3/5).  There are 8 additional tests pending but there are also 5 additional negative results.  No additional positives yet so that's good!
## Comment #3


Fon Du Lac county pulls out in the lead.
## Comment #4


Up to 14 total pending tests
## Comment #5


For 3/6, there are 7 additional negative results, and 5 additional testing pending.  Thankfully, no additional positives.

My kids school was closed today due to a high number of call ins.  I know at least one teacher had flu like symptoms.  No word on anyone being tested though.
## Comment #6


3/9
No additional positives but somehow there are 7 tests missing.  There were a total of 44 tests on Friday but now there's only 37?
## Comment #7


Is there any information on if the newly infected people wore masks and practiced social distancing OR if they chose to skip masks, etc.?
# Vaccinations in the statw


Created: 2021-06-09 17:16:20

How many of you believe we can reach over 50% fully vaccinated by the end of the month?

https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusWI/comments/nw131a/vaccinations_in_the_statw/
## Comment #1


We have been at 42 percent for a month now, unlikely. I wish the state can introduce a lottery system to encourage people to get it
## Comment #2


There’s a 0% chance. Have you looked at the [weekly vaccination rates](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/vaccine-data.htm) lately? We’re down to vaccinating 1-2% of the eligible population a week and dropping rapidly. The numbers are propped by the recent expansion in eligibility of those 12-16. We’ll maybe get to 50% by the end of summer. We’ll never reach 80%.
## Comment #3


Very unlikely. 48.7% have gotten at least their first dose:https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/vaccine-data.htm
We are 3 weeks away from June 30, so that should be our full vax percent at the end of the month as long as everyone follows through. We'd need 1.3% of the total population to get j&j in the next 3 weeks
## Comment #4


Pretty sure it won't happen. I live amongst some very proud boys and whatnots Up North, and they don't give a fuck about public health.
## Comment #5


It would be easy if DHS would just make them mandatory.

# Should get tested after exposure when fully vaccinated if not symptomatic but going to be around high risk vaccinated people?


Created: 2021-06-06 21:09:34

My brother works in a healthcare facility, and they had a Covid patient which staff members were exposed to. He worked with those staff members the last few days, so he has a secondary exposure. We’re about to get in a car with him tomorrow and drive across the country to visit vaccinated family members, including a infant baby who only has Covid antibodies through breastmilk, and some older adults who are vaccinated but potentially don’t have a strong immune response. 

We’re not really clear whether or not he should get tested or if it would even have any effect since he’s vaccinated and has no symptoms. Would the test even detect anything? 

I know they say you don’t need to get tested for yourself, but we’re not sure if it matters that he’s going to be near people who might be higher risk if he does pass along asymptomatic Covid and it breaks through their immunity. 

We’re also not sure where we can get PCR tested Monday morning that doesn’t require an appointment in Milwaukee or Madison area. I know Walgreens has appointments and you have to fill out an application, but I don’t have his insurance information and can’t fill it out for him. He’s at work so he can’t do anything now.

https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusWI/comments/ntvprp/should_get_tested_after_exposure_when_fully/
## Comment #1


If you have suspected COVID exposure, you do not need to isolate if you received your final vaccine shot more than two weeks and less than three months prior, and you remain asymptomatic. Guidelines taken from [here](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/do-you-have-to-quarantine-after-being-vaccinated-for-covid-19/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20CDC%2C%20there,received%20a%20single%2Ddose%20vaccine.).

It wouldn't be outrageous to get tested, but I probably wouldn't personally.
## Comment #2


I’d probably get tested if it were me - but I’m extra cautious. Current guidelines say it’s not necessary for your situation.
## Comment #3


If the baby is less than six weeks I would wear masks around them/not hold the baby unmasked. Just to be extra cautious, babies don't have very robust immune systems when they are very young.
## Comment #4


You could use the rapid tests every day (the ones you get at the store like the binax).  Not the most accurate, but repeating it bumps the accuracy and the tests are generally accurate for high viral loads (ie when infectious).  We've used them to screen kids around vulnerable family members.
## Comment #5


Did any of the coworkers test positive?

It takes like 3 days after exposure to start being able to spread it to other people.  I’d be curious about the timeline of when your brothers coworkers were exposed and when your brother was around the coworkers

You could probably sign up for a “ID Now” test at Walgreens (Rapid PCR) for tomorrow if you’re concerned.

But eh, It’s a second degree exposure.  Did the coworkers have symptoms or get tested?  They’re all probably vaccinated too?
## Comment #6


There is a place in Franklin (near 76th & Rawson) that has been doing tests with same day results. I don't know the name offhand, and I'm out of state right now so I can't swing by and check, but if you want/feel the need to get tested, that would be an option.
## Comment #7


I would get a test just so you feel better.  I went to Walgreens pharmacy drive thru and got my results within a few hours.
## Comment #8


You could test negative today and positive tomorrow. Unless you plan on testing daily, tests are really only worth it if you show symptoms. For piece of mind I'd wear a mask around those with compromised immune systems. I feel by now we'd hear lots of news reports about people getting covid after being vaccinated (think of healthcare workers). I'm sure it happens but I'm sure those that did get infected weren't considered healthy for the most part. The concern is valid and one I'd have too but I feel the vaccines are doing what they were designed to do. I wouldn't sweat it too much. Unfortunately not as many people as should, have this concern for others.
## Comment #9


If he wasn't in direct contact with the person who tested positive, I wouldn't worry about it.

Hi, I'm thinking of travelling to Europe and it looks like I'd need to take a PCR test before I fly out. Can anyone help out and name a few locations? Many thanks.

## Comment #1


Can you specify more than just the entire state? Your local hospital systems can offer PCR testing. Otherwise, like u/DeeBeeKay27 said, Walgreens or CVS offer the PCR test, you just need to specify thats the one you want.
