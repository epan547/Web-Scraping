# Weekly "I Think I Have It" Thread - Week of June 06, 2021

## Comment #1


I had COVID in February. I got my Moderna Vaccine in April and May, and have been fully vaccinated for two weeks. I wear my mask at work and in stores, only taking them off at restaurants and at other's homes. However, I had it off the whole time at a funeral/reception last Wednesday, where others had theirs off too. 

This afternoon, these symptoms started developing:

- Dry throat (but going away now)

- Stuffy nose (common because I have allergies)

- Very drippy nose (Again, common cuz allergies)

- Can't taste, which I expect from allergies, but I also can't smell, which is what's throwing me off, because I could taste and smell just fine approx 4.5 hours ago. 

Are these signs of a second COVID infection? Because if I have to miss 2 more weeks of work I'm gonna be so fucking mad.

Pretty minor, but I’ve had a very slight stomach discomfort the past 2 days or so. Friday (6/4) I drank a lot and got drunk lol and ate some junk food, woke up hungover but I noticed my stools were loose. Wasn’t that urgent diarrhea feeling, just looked off.

Felt better as the day went on, but stomach just felt a slight bit off. Had a couple more beers last night.

Woke up this morning feeling fine, but had another bit of loose stools in the morning. Again, wasn’t that urgent diarrhea thing. I’m wondering if it’s just because of the diet these past couple days. Very minor but I’m worried seeing people talk about diarrhea as a symptom. Will not drink at all today and just take it easy, will see how that goes.

For anyone who lost their sense of smell what did it feel like? Was it gradual or did it happen suddenly? Did you feel like you had a headcold? I had a blocked nose yesterday and today my sinuses feel weird and I've a strange smell in my right nostril, the one that's blocked
## Comment #5


Had my first round of Pfizer vaccine 2 weeks ago.  


 Last night I went to bed feeling fine. Woke up at exactly 4 am with an extremely sore throat and redness in the back of my mouth. The pain is still here and it's a struggle to swallow properly.  


 I am feeling very woozy like I am on a boat. I have motion sickness and the feeling is exactly the same, dizziness and unsteady walking. Feeling hot and cold, but no fever. Taste and smell are here, although my nose is a bit stuffed.   


 How common is sore throat as a first symptom?
# My mom tested positive

## Comment #1


Wow, I'm sorry. Yeah, stay away from her. If you show up negative , and you live with your mom, I suggest you see if you can stay somewhere else until she is no longer contagious. Covid is not fun. Avoid your mom as much as you can until she tests negative twice.
## Comment #2


I noticed that this pandemic taught people that didn't know how to wear a mask, nothing!  There's a proper way doffing and donning PPE. Forward it to her
## Comment #3


Make sure you avoid those rapid antibody tests as they're not that accurate, get tested with the PCR test.
## Comment #4


how irresponsible of her, i hope she feels guilty at least. wishing both of you all the best, hopefully you didn’t catch it.
## Comment #5


Now we are all worried about you!!! I have a friend who is the same and cannot get the vaccine and it is very worrisome for him. 

Keep us posted on how you are doing please.

# I no longer get mosquito bites after getting COVID. Is anyone else experiencing the same thing?

## Comment #1


Eh, I had the opposite. I had a mosiqute bite turn into a pretty bad cellulitis infection on my arm after scratching it. I'm 30M, no notable medical issues before covid. I'm convinced that virus has F\*\*\*'d my immune system up.
## Comment #2


Now that you mention it. I have noticed my friends and I hanging outside and they both get eaten by mosquitos and I’m not getting bothered by them. I tell them that I’m a vampire and I have cold blood lol
## Comment #3


Yes!!! I used to get eaten alive by mosquitos within seconds of being outside and now they leave me alone. I noticed this a few weeks ago and I hope it lasts. 

I was just discussing this with a friend today, but I haven’t had Covid. I noticed this after being vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine.
## Comment #4


Idk about mosquito bites being less, but my farts smell TERRIBLE!!! I don’t know if it’s my new scent buds smelling it different but it’s rank. I’m thinking of going vegetarian because it’s so horrible.
## Comment #5


You may be onto something. This is a thought. 
Anyone suffering from shortness of breath? 

One of the symptoms for long haulers is shortness of breath. The more frequently you breath, the lower your Carbon Dioxide levels. Mosquitos are attracted to Carbon Dioxide. Perhaps some of us are emitting lowers levels of Carbon Dioxide than we used to. 
I usually get eaten up by mosquitos, so this will be interesting for me to see what happens when mosquito season hits where I live.
## Comment #6


I wish.
## Comment #7


I got bitten
## Comment #8


Ma'am this is the opposite of a problem
## Comment #9


Had COVID mid-April. Mosquito bites still happen to me.
## Comment #10


I notice that I get bitten far less often than my wife. She's O+ and I'm A+ not sure why.
## Comment #11


I haven’t. I’m covered in bites right now:(
## Comment #12


I get bitten all the time
## Comment #13


I wish, sadly no
## Comment #14


Just killed a fat mosquito while reading this
## Comment #15


I still will get a few bites, but I feel that I'm much less attractive to mosquitoes than I used to be.  Noticed it on my own a few weeks ago, but thought maybe it was the meds I'm taking as a long-hauler.
## Comment #16


buggers are eating me alive
## Comment #17


Lol I'll have to ask my mom because she typically gets bitten often every year. I'll have to ask if it's any different this year
## Comment #18


Are you blood type A? Because I still do
## Comment #19


Mosquitos are usually attracted by the CO2 you emit, the warmth of your skin, your smell and by type O blood. 

My best guess would be some change in BO keeping them away. 

All the other factors shouldn’t change after a COVID infection (aside from maybe emitted CO2 if you have permanent lung damage).

What I’ve noticed is that due to the shit weather we had in spring here (central Europe), there are far less mosquitoes out there at the moment. Maybe that played into it too.
## Comment #20


I wish! I have quite a few on my legs, feet, hands. I’ve been keeping myself up at night scratching!
## Comment #21


Check to make sure your cholesterol level hasn't increased as you may be excreting less of it through the skin. Mosquitos love cholesterol.
## Comment #22


Nope! I used to get eaten alive. I haven’t had one this time around... I was thinking about this the other day
## Comment #23


Because even the mosquitoes know better to stay away from blood that has the vaccine
## Comment #24


lol time to unsub, good luck yall

## Comment #26


yeah yeah yeah yeah, mosquitos didn't bit me when i was infected, they started again as soon as i recovered
## Comment #27


Didn’t really get bit before or now
## Comment #28


We are turning into mosquitoes.
## Comment #29


You know I haven’t really noticed any mosquito bites on me yet.  And I was out on a lake this weekend.  Knock on wood.  If I don’t have to deal with mosquito bites ever again then that would be amazing.
## Comment #30


I still get bitten with the same frequency as before. Got COVID in December.
## Comment #31


Not me, I wish. I had severe covid and still the most mosquito attractive in my family.
## Comment #32


Sadly no, I’m still as tasty as usual
## Comment #33


No, but thank you for opening my eyes to one positive this thing could cause.
## Comment #34


You have mosquitoes already?
## Comment #35


Had cellulitis for the first time before Covid
## Comment #36


I haven’t been touched by a mosquito in years.  There must be something in my chemistry that changed.
## Comment #37


Yes!!! Wtf?! I used to get eaten alive. I’ve been out all week in 90 degree weather, humid & damp & not one mosquito has gotten me
## Comment #38


Even nature is avoiding the ccp ma de virus
# Mom is now on a ventilator

## Comment #1


I’ve been there and you are not alone. My mom experienced the same decline when she had it back in March. I’ll hope for the best for your mom and your family.

Many have gone through what you are going through right now. If you need someone to chat to my DM’s are open
## Comment #2


Hello, I was exactly in the same position as you in April and I understand how you must feel. My mom was on a ventilator for 34 days and I basically had to deal with all the communications with the hospital because my father does not speak English. During this time, I felt completely powerless. The doctors were asking me for consent for things I have no idea about. I was scared to make the wrong decision and in the event that she doesn't make it, I would feel immensely guilty. I already felt guilt because she got the virus from me and my brother. 

When she first got admitted, she kept getting worse. She had multiple bacterial infections throughout her fight and at one point the doctors told me she needed some "seriously good luck" in order to make it. I was suffering from anticipatory grief from that point forward. However, they tried a second antibiotics and it worked and it helped her cleared her bacterial infection and bacterial pneumonia. She slowly started to get better and they were finally able to perform a tracheostomy for her. From that point forward, she just got better and better. They were able to wean her off the ventilator and gave her a different oxygen therapy called High Flow Nasal Cannula. After a week on that, she was changed to a regular Nasal Cannula.

Currently, she is still in the hospital recovering from the extended ICU stay. She has lost most of her muscles and can't stand or walk unassisted. But she is not in a critical condition anymore and I am extremely proud of her and feel very fortunate that she is still here with me today. I don't really have any advice because I struggled a lot myself. However, the doctor is right and you need to take it 1 day at a time. It will be like a roller coaster of emotions. 1 day of good news followed by 1 day of bad news. You need to stay strong and remain hopeful and if you ever need anyone to talk to, don't hesitate to send me a message.

>Today morning, I got a call from the doctor that her vitals were not good and her Spo2 dropped to 40's.

Did they tell you why this happened? Under what circumstances did she desaturate?
## Comment #5


Praying! Is your mom partly vaccinated?
## Comment #6


You have to wait, but give her all the love you can, make her feel better, let her know that everything is ok is the best thing you can do now, she needs that as much as the medicine
# Does anyone feel a little stiffness in the chest, my doctors doesn’t give me clear answers. He just says it will take time.

## Comment #2


This is a typical long covid symptom. I had it for months as well.
# Breakthrough Case

## Comment #1


Breakthrough cases are not that rare. I'm surprised anyone would call this a medical anomaly. The vaccines are not 100% effective. They should reduce symptoms in most people but they don't prevent you from getting covid. There are people that have gotten breakthrough cases and been hospitalized or died - I would call *those* very rare. But just getting mild symptomatic covid will absolutely happen to some people post vaccine.
## Comment #2


You have relatively low risk of developing COVID-19 (viral pneumonia) at your age. If you are fit and healthy. 

It's possible we have reached the point where the virus has mutated beyond the S-protein target.
## Comment #3


I had similar symptoms without the vaccine a few months ago. My mom works in healthcare and they all got Pfizer and a number of nurses got Covid a few months after. The weirder part was the facility told them they didn’t have to quarantine since they were vaccinated. I would not have expected that to be the case. Some has mild symptoms and one had to be hospitalized but she was a smoker so they attributed it to that
## Comment #4


And likewise, I had those same symptoms in April and tested negative. Such a bizarre virus.

Neuropathy is fairly common after acute critical illness/vent and it’s often hard to track back and figure out the specific cause. For example, I’ve got a weird dead zone on my left index finger that’s probably never going to resolve. That said, give yourself some time with the foot. My hospital stay was about the same length as yours, so I can say from experience that debility really does take time to “fix.” When I first got to inpatient rehab, PT team thought they saw me dropping my left foot but whatever they were seeing was mostly gone by discharge. Another thing to consider: I definitely had neuropathic pain in my feet for the first few months which was a product of muscle regrowth. Flexeril (cyclobenzaprine) was helpful with the feet zaps but be careful with it if you’re still taking morphine.
