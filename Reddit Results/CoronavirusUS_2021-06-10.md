Telemedicine I've been using before corona. 

1 dollar visits, yearly subscription. First year was only 20.00 dollars
## Comment #3


Nothing new to add.. but I really like PlushCare! $99 without insurance or a $10 copay. There are 2 male and 1 female doctors. I see Natalie! She’s really nice with a warm and kind personality. She keeps things quick and simple :)
## Comment #4


I’ve used DocBright.com for derm appointments. Would add that to the list as well

They're normally for pediatric when your primary is closed, but for COVID-19, they did adult telemedicine. I was able to do a video call and get an antibody test scheduled at no cost.
## Comment #6


I use Quick Rx to get my thyroid meds. It is not cheap at $79 bucks every 3 months. But it works for me. Most others don't list thyroid as a condition they will rx for.
## Comment #7


Doxy.me for psychotherapy
## Comment #8


SteadyMD. Get paired with a doctor who matches your life/needs/concerns. Talk with that same doctor over the coming days, weeks, and months over text/phone/video chat. First appointment a full hour.
## Comment #9


I’ve been using Amwell for over 3 years now. There are a lot of discount codes that can be found on the web.
## Comment #10


I have asthma and chronic bronchitis but don't have insurance bc I have a disabled child whose needs come before mine. Does anyone know if any of these would write me an excuse from work bc I am high risk?
## Comment #11


Anyone aware of any telemed which can do a physical?

Which is the cheapest?
## Comment #16


Highly recommend PlushCare! You can even add family members to your account for free.
## Comment #17


Depending on your insurance you can teleconference with local therapists. psychiatrists, and counselors for no additional charge. Been doing it since March for both a psych doc and a therapist. Immensely helpful.
## Comment #18


I have personally used both of these and had good experiences. FetchMD also offers house calls in some situations.

# CDC Vaccine Finder


Created: 2021-02-25 19:09:25

The CDC just released a vaccine finder tool that is updated daily with location and amounts available.

Here's the link: [https://vaccinefinder.org/](https://vaccinefinder.org/)

https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/lse8gm/cdc_vaccine_finder/
## Comment #1


Thank you!  In CA we also have [vaccinateca.com](https://www.vaccinateca.com).
## Comment #2


This seems deceptive- I put in my zip code and it listed several cvs and Walgreens locations as “in stock” but all of those appointments are fully booked. It makes it appear as if appointments are available at these locations when actually they are not.

Edit- it does clarify when you select a location, but from the initial search page it seems like these locations will have availability, and it’s only when you go through to the external sites for the various pharmacies that you see there is no availability.
## Comment #3


Thanks!  This is really great!  

In my area, only commercial pharmacies are listed and I believe those are all federally supplied doses.  Our County has a very robust vaccination system as well.

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html

Is the link to the CDC's redirect site to individual States.  It might come in handy if the other site is not helpful.
## Comment #4


In NM you can sign up for a vaccine on the DOH website. But guess what?! Even if you are a senior there is NO available appointments. No phone number. No help to expedite as NM does not actually have the vaccine in the state. Dont waste your time. It is wrong to keep telling Americans to sign up
For a shot that is NOT available!!!!!! Or eligible or sick enough. While some other moron can get the shot elsewhere like Texas where they dont have to wear masks anymore. This country is never coming back.
## Comment #5

## Comment #6


Thank you for posting this. I used it and just last week started my vaccinations!
## Comment #7


Is there a resource anywhere online that lists what residency requirements the states each have? Like, not just a map or list of where 16+ can get an appointment but a map or list of the states that don’t require you to be currently living there?
## Comment #8


I used this to help get my vaccine!
## Comment #9


That site is how I found appointments for my parents, husband and I. Yes, it is not always accurate. But just listing the nearby places that do offer the vaccine was helpful enough to eventually find appointments after a few days of searching.
# America Will Buy 500 Million Doses Of Corona Vaccine From Pfizer, Will Be Distributed In 92 Poor Countries

## Comment #1


This is great news coming from us! We had to vaccinate our own and now that we have a decent amount vaccinated, let’s go help everyone else get up so we can end this pandemic together!
## Comment #2


What is the cost of each vaccine if they are produced at cost?

They are about $15 --but this is not the wholesale price.

It's 730 rupees in India which is about $10 USD.

500 million vaccines is not nearly enough.

It is worth trillions to the world to vaccinate everyone. 

It is a vast sum to pay but every developed country should pony up the funds because letting covid run through the world is a guaranteed fiasco. 

Unfortunately, Astra Zeneca is the inexpensive one but not as effective against variants.

[Johnson and Johnson might also be more cost-effective](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/covid-19-vaccine-cost-eu-versus-us/)

There are other methods which had promised lower costs and less refrigeration needs....I don't know why nothing is being done to bring those to market.
## Comment #3


We have a ballooning debt and our own economic problems coming our way, in the form of inflation. We give the world the most amount of money of any country. We can't allocate part of what we already give for this?
# CDC study: COVID-19 infections in vaccinated people are much less severe than in unvaccinated people

## Comment #1


I’m more interested to know if vaccinated people don’t get long term Covid symptoms.
## Comment #2


Isn’t that one of the main points of a vaccine?
## Comment #3


I really wish they would do a huge psa awareness campaign to explain exactly what vaccination means. It can't be a black and white "why don't you understand this" thing. There's so much disinformation and negligence of the base concept of community and public health (sometimes even ignored by the CDC itself) that a basic reminder of what we're actually trying to accomplish would be useful. They need to define the problem and set goals better.
## Comment #4


I think this is the main point of the vaccines. Drastically reduce symptoms. Even if people get sick after they are fully vaccinated, you have to come from it that it would have been MUCH worse if there weren't vaccinated. 

My friend only had one dose and he got the virus and was out of commission for a day or two, but I would guess he would have been much worse off if didn't get the first dose yet.
## Comment #5


That’s not what vaccinated means. Catching a disease and surviving isn’t the same as getting a vaccine that prevents the damage in the first place. If you catch measles it completely destroys immune system memory. Maybe people who caught one strain of Covid are immune for a time, but another strain could potentially make them sick again. There’s a reason why we keep getting information about the effectiveness for vaccines against variants. 

Too many people are confident in “I caught it, lived, now I’m fine.” No. They aren’t. People die of the flu every year even if they’ve had it before because mutations happen. This isn’t chickenpox.
## Comment #6


Awesome. Now do Ivermectin.
## Comment #7


Water is wet.
## Comment #8


This is quite obvious
## Comment #9


I have noticed that nails fly off the pavement and stick into my body. I’ve got them in my neck. Any research done on this?
## Comment #10


I mean obviously. That’s what the vaccines are designed to do.
## Comment #11


*shocked pikachu face*
## Comment #12


duh?
## Comment #13


For now
## Comment #14


I got Covid and it was a walk in the park, don’t see the point in getting a vaccine now that I have superior antibodies + T-cells.
## Comment #15


This title is misleading. It neglects an entire category of unvaccinated people who received natural immunity via an infection.
## Comment #16


The idea that a one size fits all vaccine that effectively changes...changes your DNA to produce the very thing-spike proteins-that we as a species are fighting against was the only way to go. There was no way in the world the vaccine would be perfect.

This table appears to have out of date info, at least for the US. For example, Pfizer/BioNTech storage recommendations were updated to allow a month of storage at refrigerator temperatures.

## Comment #1


That's it??
## Comment #2


Should have charged him with non-violent marijuana possession. He'd get atleast 10 years.
## Comment #3


Should have gotten more time
## Comment #4


Should be 5 counts of attempted murder per vial.
## Comment #5


What was his motive? It says that he admitted to doing it intentionally, but did he ever admit an intent?
## Comment #6


You guys are complaining that 3 years is too little... Imagine what his sentence would be if he stormed the capitol...
