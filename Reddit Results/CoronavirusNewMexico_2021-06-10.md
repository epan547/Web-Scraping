Iâ€™ve been seeing a lot of folks say the state hasnâ€™t contacted them for their 2nd shot, so I thought Iâ€™d post this here and sticky it.

I tried to use the website to change the scheduled date and ended up having to call the DOH to ask for help. The website has you cancel an appointment before you can reschedule. The agent took my information and an epidemiologist is calling me back.

I think the web site scheduling is more for people who haven't had their second vaccine scheduled yet. Mine was but Sam's scheduled it for four weeks instead of three. I wanted to see if there was another pharmacy that could do it in the third week.

This actually just saved me a lot of hassle. Thanks for posting!
## Comment #4


I've been fully vaccinated by the State since the end of January, and I continually get spammed to make an appointment and get my vaccine.  Not sure what that's about.

I think most on this sub have been vaccinated, but if anyone hasnâ€™t had a chance because theyâ€™re working from home with a small child, this could be helpful.
# Saturday June 5 - Monday June 7, 2021: 71 confirmed cases/day (214 cases total), 2 deaths/day (6 deaths total); 7-day averages: 88 cases/day, 3 deaths/day.

The 7-day averages are approximate due to the lack of a breakout between Saturday-Tuesday last week.  

The 7-day average of confirmed cases is 6% lower than Friday, 15% lower than 1 week ago, and 61% lower than 1 month ago.  The raw 7-day average is equal to that from September 9th, 2020, the minimum we reached at the end of last summer.

With cases so low and dropping both here and nationwide, I'm going to reduce these posts to once per week. 

Take care all of you and please continue to make safe and prudent choices.  COVID risk is much, much lower than it was 6 months ago, and probably lower than it's been since cases began to rise last spring; however, the risk is not zero and it's in our best interests to minimize spread to protect those that cannot (or for whatever reason choose not to) receive the vaccine.

Thanks for keeping it going!

Hereâ€™s to hoping this sub can be forgotten before too too long

Thanks for posting!  Appreciate it and take care.

P.S. One thing I noticed in yesterday's update was hospitalizations at 81, which is the lowest I can remember seeing in some time.

4 of the deaths are recent.

Life has felt SO much better vaccinated. But a prize doesnâ€™t hurt - so proud of our stateâ€™s leaders!
## Comment #2


Does anyone know why doses administered and doses recurved are different? It's in the infographic at the end of the article.

It came up in discussion today and no one had a definitive answer.

## Comment #1


Most dashboards give all the numbers.  Like NM's dashboard gives all of those different percentages.

Generally the media tends to quote the percentage of eligible.
# Wednesday June 2, 2021: 71 confirmed cases (1.1% of tests), 4 additional deaths; 7-day average: 93 cases/day.

The 7-day average of confirmed cases is 13% lower than yesterday, 40% lower than 1 week ago, and 57% lower than 1 month ago.  

As noted by several commenters, many of the currently reported deaths are from >30 days ago.  The 7-day average of reported deaths is 2/day, but I will de-emphasize that as it likely is not particularly reflective of the current state of things.

## Comment #2


No proof that you've been vaccinated is needed to enter. I wonder if they plan to verify that winners are vaccinated.
## Comment #3


This is precisely the way to increase our vaccination numbers. Once Ohio started the lottery program, I hoped it would spread across the US. This is far better incentivizing than Biden's "durr, you can take off your mask now" BS.

Fun fact had the gating criteria not changed a month ago BernCo would just be coming out of yellow tier tomorrow when the map updates. Great numbers though hope they keep going down.
## Comment #2


Both reported deaths were >30 days ago.
