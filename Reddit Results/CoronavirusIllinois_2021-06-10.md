# VACCINE ADMINISTRATION DETAILS


Created: 2021-01-27 22:17:45

The best compilation of vaccine administration information that I have seen so far has been this document that is maintained by Impact and updated daily: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nuDrRyyej3uJRJKYBQbAYrxgj-Gr-yKmnwQU7oqaBFU/edit

This is a medical professional collaborative team, so please contribute information if you know something that is not included in that document. There is contact information included at the top.

Who is eligible? Everyone 12 and over.


Many places allow for walkins now, but make sure to check before hand.


Only Pfizer is approved for ages 12-17, so if you are getting a minor vaccinated, make sure to take care which type is available.

Is there a list of who is considered a frontline essential worker?
## Comment #2


How can i prove my eligibility as a 1b essential worker ? Pay stub? Name badge?
## Comment #3


I work full time in retail as a cashier but it is non-essential, I believe. (We sell home goods.) It feels like every industry is a higher priority, and I see many work from home jobs like media and finance are eligible in 1c but I am not. It’s frustrating, and I wish they would just go by age rather than being so specific by various industries.
## Comment #4


The newest change to Walgreens' vaccine registration is phenomenal.  It's as good as the old GUI was bad.   

On a non-GUI basis, [Walgreens in Illinois will get extra vaccines](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/vaccine/ct-coronavirus-vaccine-walgreens-federal-program-doses-20210202-bdbyjw2tjvflfkxifyu5smds5m-story.html) and [added 78 more sites](https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/walgreens-adds-covid-vaccinations-to-78-locations-in-illinois/2429477/).

Best of luck on securing an appointment, all.
## Comment #5


AllVax has changed extensively.  If you are registered there, I recommend you go in and update your account.  Besides breaking down more of who can get done, they also have an option to send your information to partners who can also provide the vaccination.
## Comment #6


Hi folks,

My company was tapped to do vaccines for AllVax, and whenever someone doesn't show for an appointment, they call employees off a waiting list and they can take the slot.  Half of my staff have gotten it so far, and I'm freaking thrilled.  I put myself at the very end of the line, so... *soon*.

Anyway, yesterday, one of my staff went who has a penicillin allergy.  Because of this, they asked her to wait 30m instead of the 15m.  She had zero side effects, but I wanted to be sure people were aware of this potential as penicillin allergies are common enough.
## Comment #7


I'm curious to know how people are actually getting vaccinated. My wife is a frontline worker that is qualified to be vaccinated but can't find a single place that has any inventory. What do we do?
## Comment #8


HyVee refreshes at midnight.  I was able to see the appointments instantly at midnight.  

Sycamore HyVee has appointments and is a little over an hour from the NW burbs.  Use zip 60138
## Comment #9


Thanks to you and everyone who has contributed to disseminating information about vaccination. 

I've sent many links to my friends to help them and their parents get vaccinated. Let's do this.
## Comment #10


Does anyone have any recommendations as to what are the best sites to try and sign up for the vaccine or even at what specific times should I be looking for appointments? I was thinking of using the Cook County site, then Walgreens and CVS.
## Comment #11


Does Walgreens or CVS allow Chicago residents to get vaccinated outside of Chicago?

Example: I live in Chicago, but there are vaccine appointments available in other communities downstate. Will Walgreens allow that?

Any guidance would be appreciated, thank you.

Yes, I know I can call them. But pharmacies are closed at this late hour.
## Comment #12


Take this post down already -- it's way out of date.
## Comment #13


FYI, AllVax (Lake County) started emailing last night.  All but one family members have an appointment now!  

Check your email, maybe even spam.  Came at 1am.
## Comment #14


New York Times currently lists each state's percent population partially or fully vaccinated, along with a projection of when the country will have 50%, 70%, and 90% vaccination. At what percent might our state allow any who wants a vaccine to have one?
## Comment #15


Is there group 2 vaccines anywhere?! Is anyone that’s in group 2 gotten vaccinated? How?

This very much depends on Covid 19 numbers in the next two weeks. If there's a Memorial Day surge, we will not move to Phase V.

Brace yourselves for the new stories about the people complaining about stores having requirements when the state does not, like has happened in every other state.

People myopically focus on what stores can and cannot do on this stupid mask issue.
## Comment #2


Permanently or temporary? Because there's no point in reopening if nobody is going to follow it.

408 ÷ 41758 = 0.98%
## Comment #2


Week over week changes in the 7-day moving averages:

**New cases down 31.5%**

**Deaths down 7.1%**

**Hospitalizations down 24.8%**

**ICU usage down 23.8%**

**Ventilator usage down 24.7%**
## Comment #3


further reference:

  * 28 days ago: 1,795 cases reported
  * 21 days ago: 1,633 cases reported
  * 14 days ago: 1,139 cases reported
  * 7 days ago: 478 cases reported
  * today: 408 cases reported

Not as remarkable of a drop when compared to prior weeks, but it's still a lower figure, and still represents about 15% fewer new cases than what we reported a week ago.
## Comment #4


How come the number of adults vaccinated hasn’t moves from 68% in the past three days although we’ve vaccinated 100k+ people?
## Comment #5


Ever so slight increase in hospitalization, up by 8?

Hopefully just noise.

Doses up, that's cool. 

Positivity doing well, average has hit 1%. Otherwise seems like a normal Wednesday.
## Comment #6


Regardless of it being a holiday week last week, our rolling average is still down this week which is great. Keep those vaccines going!
## Comment #7


I work in property management and one lady at work who we got word tested positive just refuses to stay inside. It’s *maddening*

# When is this vaccine lottery going to happen?


Created: 2021-06-10 01:03:12

Pritzker teased last week that they were working a a vaccine lottery.  They said they even allocated $7 million for prizes in his budget that just got approved.  When are they going to announce it?

I’d hate for people to hold off of getting vaccinated because they heard about the lotto and think it’ll only be for new vaccinations.

Not only that though, it’ll prompt a bunch of new people to get vaccinated.

Come on Pritzker, what are you waiting for?

(Also, I’m not asking because I’m interested in the lottery myself.. been fully vaccinated since 3/9)

Get vaccinated for your 0.00000001% chance to win 10 thousand dollars, but with a higher chance of having side effects from an experimental vaccine. Riiiiiiiiiight......

Exactly 1% daily test positivity rate today. Slightly higher than the last few days, but things are going extremely well overall. I love to see exponential decay at work.

7 day average of vaccines is creeping up. Love to see that.

25 million tests by Thursday.

791 hospitalized.
## Comment #7


I think kids will be padding the vax numbers for some time now, considering most schools are probably out for the summer this week or next.
## Comment #8


Got a test over the weekend because I've been coughing up a storm - came back negative!
## Comment #9


With things opening up, and with not everyone being vaxxed ... it's probably going to be tough to keep-up the massive week-over-week drops in cases, but ... this is still fewer cases than we saw on tuesday of last week.
## Comment #10


First day we haven't had a huge drop from the previous week in a while. 401 last week. Don't remember positivity
## Comment #11


Hospitalizations need to get below 750 ASAP. If they hold above 750 for 10 days after June 11, the phase will go back. State has threatened that and I don’t want that to happen.

“While the removal of occupancy limits and other rules represents a significant step forward in the COVID pandemic, state officials have cautioned residents that it is possible for the state to move back to previous phases in the following instances:

If hospital admissions for COVID-19 illnesses increase to more than 150 hospitalizations per day over a 10-day monitoring period.

If the number of COVID patients in hospitals climbs above 750 and stays there for more than 10 days.

If the state’s mortality rate increases and goes above a 0.1 daily average.

If ICU bed availability statewide drops below 20% over a 10-day monitoring period.”

Not worried about the other 3, but who knows with the hospitalizations what the state will do to us

Yesterday, I went to a beach. Met some vaccinated dudes and we chatted for 3 hours. We exchanged numbers. I work remote and I love being online but I have missed normal human interactions so much.

I’m looking forward to doing normal things with our little guy.

I would like it if this data started reporting how many of the newly infected have been / have not been vaccinated. I'm not sure if that's possible, but I think that would be a 'nice to have' data point.

## Comment #20


Let's be clear in congratulating our political leaders in the rollout and mass vax sites across the state. The NG did an AMAZING job at the Belleville site and now the local hospitals can take over smaller sites. I w as ired almost an hour for my first shot as a teacher and just sat my kids got their 2nd shot and the whole thing took less than 20 mins.

Pritzker locked down when he needed to and our state used actual science to defend the procedure and how to come out of it. God dammit I'm so happy to be in this state.
