Wednesday, June 9, 2021 - COVID-19 Metrics for Georgia  

Tests were up week over week but that did not translate to cases, which were down 80 from last week (-16%).  Antigen cases were up while PCR cases were down. 

25 deaths reported today, just under the 7-day rolling average of 26. 

ICU patient counts are up by 110 over last week, though COVID-19 Hospital Patient counts remain at pandemic lows.
## Comment #3


While some numbers have been bouncing up and down, it seems like most of the bad numbers (numbers we want to go down) are trending down.  And where the numbers started going up last year, it seems like we are going to remain pretty steady if not see even more decline.  Will be interesting to see what pans out after these summer holidays.
## Comment #4


Part of my job is sometimes to watch live data from a system I'm trying to control.

I really appreciate the overlay of the last year's data.

What's got me thinking about those two things is the way the old data compares to today's.  I see those little week long flattening of curves that were trending down and I get worried that we're losing control of the system we're trying to control.

Please go get your shots.  If you're vaccinated, please encourage hold outs to get theirs.

With the Delta variant here in America (and probably in Georgia), there's the chance we could be an incubator for it.  The only way to cut it off is vaccination (or another total lockdown).

Please, please, please get your shots...

I'm not sure what the proportion of 'whites without college degrees' has to do with anything when the article makes the following points:
  
>Black Americans, who vote overwhelmingly Democratic, aren't getting the vaccine at the rate of whites. Less than a quarter of Black Americans had gotten at lease one vaccine dose as of Tuesday, according to the CDC. It's the lowest of any racial or ethnic group listed.  
  
>Young people, who also lean heavily toward Democrats, are also less likely to get vaccinated. More than 80% of people over 65 have gotten at least one shot, compared with just 45% of 18- to 24-year-olds and 51% of those 25 to 39.  
  
Do we even have vaccination rate data controlled for race AND education?
## Comment #3


Just because your educated doesn't mean you're intelligent. Most of the educated are in debt up to there eyeballs and don't even work in what they went to school for.While the former have small businesses and good credit

Tuesday, June 8, 2021 - COVID-19 Metrics for Georgia  

By counting 38 additional death reports today, Georgia passed 21,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic.  That is an average of 46.4 deaths each and every day for 453 days. 

Cases were up week over week for the third consecutive day.  Today it was +64%, or 153 increase over last Tuesday.  Note that last Tuesday was the day after a holiday so that data may have been lower than usual.  The 392 cases reported was 5 above the 7-day rolling average.

Based on the feedback from yesterday's change I added 2020 trends as a dash-dot line where possible.  DPH didn't start publishing bed data in 2020 until May.   

I also made a change to the vaccine stat in the right column.   Instead of tracking inventory it now calculates the days until Georgia would reach 70% fully vaccinated population.  It calculates this as follows:  (70% of Population - Fully Vaccinated) / 7 day rolling average of final vaccinations.

I wonder what total immunity looks like, given the vaccinations AND the number of people who got infected and recovered.

Memorial Day spike? Hope not.

ha! "delay" nothing. short of another outbreak, there are going to be large pockets of people who never get the vaccine. at this point im just hoping we can get over 50% in my county and that a vaccine resistant strain doesn't show up. 

my hopes are low. almost no one wears their mask already. way too many people around here are *proud* about not getting the vaccine. herd immunity is practically out of the question 

"it didn't hurt me so it must not be a problem," has practically become the county's motto
## Comment #3


Delay a return to normalcy where? Most states have returned to normal. Reimposing mask mandates and venue capacity limits is 100% off the table in Texas, Florida, Georgia and many others.
## Comment #4


The state of Georgia’s vaccination record is not surprising at all. While we are trying to remain positive among what we’ve not seen before. I think each person living in Georgia knows at least one or more that has not been vaccinated and/or refuses to. While remembering we have a governor who honestly shows how much he doesn’t care because this does not affect him or family personally. The main focus now for those governing Georgia is “Voter Suppression”. The harder they push, the harder we will do all that is within our power to assure that our vote is counted.
## Comment #5


At current 7-day average rate for people becoming fully vaccinated, Georgia would not hit 70% vaccinated until Tuesday, November 9.  That's 154 days from today.

**Monday, June 7, 2021 - COVID-19 Metrics for Georgia**  

There are some changes to the main case chart today, I decided it was time to add a comparison to last year's 7-day rolling average for cases to watch how the state is progressing this year versus last year.  

In 2020 the inflection point toward the summer case peak started the week after Memorial Day and hit the top on July 28.  Having this trend line will help track the state against what may be a growth period for COVID.   Looking at this year's numbers on [the weekly update](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusGA/comments/nuki06/week_ending_66_covid19_metrics_for_georgia_how/h0xxhao/?context=3), when you adjust for the third of the population in Georgia that is vaccinated, the case numbers are very consistent.   If that holds, by late July Georgia may experience a spike of 2,500 new cases per day, which would be almost 7x the current rate.

I'd like feedback on this and if you would like similar changes to the Beds, Deaths and Cases per 100K Georgians stats or keep them with the 6 month+ current view?

The week after Memorial Day was fairly quiet, similar to last year. However, the last 2 days Georgia has experience small week-over-week increases in cases.  Up 11% today, and 7% yesterday.

There were a net zero new death reports.  Unknown if that probable that was moved became a confirmed or just how the numbers fell.  

Looking at the vaccination numbers, curiously the DPH updated the number of vaccines shipped to be as of 6/4, but the volumes didn't change.  The number of "final" doses dropped more than half to just over 12,000 this week for Monday.    


&#x200B;

**7-Day Average Views for 6/7 (Chart 2)**

The 7-day average for cases ended the day Monday at 365, down more than 130 from last Monday.   This is the new 12 month low. 

The 7-day average for COVID Hospital Patients dropped more than 120 over the last 7 days.    The the 7-day average of 598 is below than the 12-Month low also set last week. 

The 7-day average for the death rate is 21 per day, down 4from last Monday and breaking a 2 week string of increases. 

Summer Spike Peaks:  Cases: 3,742 on 7/19   Hospital Patients: 3,200 on 7/30   Deaths: 73 on 8/13  
Fall Spike Peaks (to date):  Cases: 9,778 on 1/13  Hospital Patients: 5,621 on 1/16  Deaths: 139 on 1/20

  
Fall '20 Low Points:  Cases 1,153 on 10/8    Hospital Patients 1,256 on 10/12  Deaths: 24 on 10/31  
Spring '21 Low Points: Cases 365 on 6/7    Hospital Patients 598 on 6/7  Deaths: 19 on 5/14
## Comment #3


I like the idea of the last year trend line. The pool of available "hosts" is much fewer with both vaccinations and previous infections, but you can't deny there's some seasonality factor. Last year it started in Arizona first, and they've been flat-ish recently, so that's a good sign.
## Comment #4


Big fan of the trend comparison! 

It’ll be interesting to see the differences and similarities compared to last year with so many places not requiring mask now if you’re vaccinated. But we all know people not vaccinated are going in sans mask too.
## Comment #5


Trend comparison is a winner! I’d like to see hospitalization and death comparisons as well.
## Comment #6


Does your analysis take into account effective reproduction rate?  And how exactly have you adjusted for the percent vaccinated?  

And from a more qualitative perspective, I don't see why we should expect such a spike, given that the epidemiological conditions have changed pretty dramatically between now and last June.  To me that seems like an unsupported prediction.

But I'm just some guy, and you've been looking at the data a helluva lot more than I have, so I'm sure I'm missing something.

Week Ending June 6, 2021

All four of the major indicators tracked were down this week.  Let's look at that with an eye on last year at this time. In 2020 the week after Memorial Day was 5/31, this week it's 6/6 so let's check that for a comparison.

PCR Tests this year were up about 2,000 over last year.  With the holiday Monday limiting testing available, this is very consistent.

Cases this year are 2.5K versus the 2020 number of 4.1K, definitely a benefit to see that down.   If we consider that this year 1/3 of people are vaccinated, a comparable case number might be 2.7K so Georgia is in that range.

New hospitalizations of 289 this week (remember, this stat is hospitalization at the time of COVID-19 Diagnosis).  Last year was 507 which was also a drop from the prior week.  Factor in the 1/3 vaccinated and we might expect 334 so this is very positive.

Death reports lag, and it seems even more so in 2021 than they did in 2020.  This week's 149 compares well to last years 217.  Adjusted for vaccinated people and that estimate would be 144 deaths.

So, what does this say?  One view is that the vaccinations have suppressed about 1/3 of the events we would have seen, and even more with hospitalizations.   When you take those out of the equation however, the spread among the at-risk population seems pretty consistent.   Then the question becomes, in 4 weeks will Georgia see cases be triple what they are today?   If so, what happens after cases go back up after 20 weeks of declines?  Stay tuned.
## Comment #3


Thank you for this analysis. Hoping we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, but the data won’t lie.
## Comment #4


Sorry for being crass, but this is SO EFFING PROMISING!!! The hospitalized and deaths numbers are at levels we haven't seen in months.

Data like this really make me think we, at least in this state, might get past this in short order.

## Comment #3


Seems unlikely we'll get to true 0, so I imagine it will linger around this average for a while
## Comment #4


Thanks for keeping up with this. Is there a way to see the data for the entire duration of the pandemic?
## Comment #5


What I’m wondering…. Is there an emergency switch for Kemp to pull once we reach a tipping point or does he plan on just letting it sweep over GA?
