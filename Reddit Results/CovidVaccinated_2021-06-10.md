# I'm a teen with anti-vax parents who just got vaccinated! No bad side effects yet!


Created: 2021-06-03 19:30:18

Hi, I'm a 16 year old teen who just got vaccinated despite having anti-vax conspiracy theorist parents (I say this because I want to clarify that they're not vaccine-hesitant, they are legitimately crazy)! I tried to go to a Walgreens a few weeks ago, but got rejected due to their policy requiring a parent to be with a minor during vaccination. I saw a comment by a CVS employee on reddit last week though, who told me that people older than 16 don't need a parent present, nor their signature. 

I made an appointment online, which confirms parental consent with a simple checkbox online rather than a paper form like Walgreens does. Today I went there with a classmate who drove me there. They called out my last name in the waiting list, the nurse walked me to the booth, took my temperature, DOB, and vaccinated me in the arm of my choice! Walked around the store for 15 minutes, let the nurse know I was okay, and that was that. No paperwork or anything.

After 4 hours, I only have a slightly sore arm and the mildest headache that I can't even feel half the time. No other side effects currently, but we'll see how things are going tomorrow, haha. Looking forward to the next shot and the return to normal life!

Edit: Today's better! Arm's a lot less sore and I have no headache at all. I'm not tired or anything, feelin' great :)

That‚Äôs how teens get excited nowadays?
## Comment #2


For this young lady‚Äôs demographic 1-17yrs of age, this is the stated mortality rate. ‚Äú0.00000090‚Äù
## Comment #3


Similar thing here. Mom seriously on the conspiracy side but did surprisingly sign my parental consent form, gave me a lot of worried rants but 2 weeks after my 2nd shot and I‚Äôm still happy with my decision. 16 years old almost 17 and this is the 2nd vaccine ive had (apart from a few right after birth)...
## Comment #4


technical note- this is really weird how this post was cross-posted and I got perma-banned from another sub r/Coronavirus. for "Anti-vax" How is that even possible?

REDDIT-- you are on notice here that advising a minor to do this is not right by any circumstances. A number of very bad health outcomes could occur. Insurance fraud is one thing, but if a minor became ill-what if they tried to hide that for instance? There are just multiple valid reasons why this is dangerous.

Huge props to you for thinking critically and taking care of your own health! That took guts (and persistence, obviously). And if your side effects *are* worse tomorrow, don't worry! It's normal and they'll pass.
## Comment #7


If you were my child I'd ground you for at least 6 months for going behind my back and doing this.  I'm not anti-vax and I support everyone getting the vaccine where it is appropriate, but I also support requiring parental permission for children under 18.  I get you don't agree with their views, but did it ever occur to you they may know things about your medical history they haven't told you about?  I got the J&J vaccine and my 12 year old granddaughter got one of the others but she had my daughter's approval.

Does anyone know of any places which allowed people under 16 to get the vax w/o parents consent? Thanks in advance
## Comment #21


You are smarter than your parents. I am glad that it worked out for you.
## Comment #22


Wow. I hope you don‚Äôt get any bad effects. Shocking, but then again I was a teen and made unpopular decisions too. 
Good luck. Bless you

Why would you get a vaccine for a disease with a 0.00000090 mortality rate for your age group? You literally have a higher chance of dying from the vaccine than the virus.
# Received 2nd dose and I could not stop vomiting overnight.


Created: 2021-06-10 10:17:54

I‚Äôm severely emetophobia so my worst fears came true unfortunately. It‚Äôs not typical of me to get sick so easily that makes me vomit.  

I received my second dose of Moderna this afternoon. Before that I had a good meal - oatmeals and some vegetables so I could feel energized and better prepare for the side effects. 

I had my dinner then headed to bed as I was starting to become fatigued and feel sleepy. But I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep due to my insomnia and arm pain at the injection site. 

I started burning up and the temperature climbed up to 39.0C, the highest during the night. I took Tylenol and still couldn‚Äôt fall asleep. Then all of a sudden I became so nauseous that when I got up, I immediately dry heaved. 

Eventually I vomited and it repeated roughly 6 times. The force was so hard that I wet myself. I ended up lying on the floor to soothe the nausea. I fell asleep in short intervals punctuated by waking up in order to vomit.

In the morning the fever is slowly going down to 38.5 C and I was able to have  slice of bread. I also drank some hot water and took another pill of Tylenol. 

Here‚Äôs hoping that I do not vomit again.

## Comment #1


I live in Canada so is there a way for me to report the side effects to some overseeing agency?
## Comment #2


Happened to me buddy, I had this experience in April. I still haven't fully recovered to this day although I have gotten better. I would recommend getting checked out, my organs were starting to shutdown after 24 hours.

## Comment #3


I also vomited after the second dose two weeks ago. Felt horrible for 3 days after which was surprising since the first one had no side effects. I did have covid in January but the side effects from vaccine were much worse.
## Comment #4


My worst nightmare :(
## Comment #5


That means it's working. It gets rid of all the bad in your body. I am in love with this vaccine
## Comment #6


I had violent puking after my first dose. Definitely not fun. No fever for me though
# 26M - Positive experience with J&J vaccine

## Comment #1


Got the Johnson vaccine last week on lunch break.  

Didn't feel well the next day, but powered through it.  Felt achy.  Went to the gym, but didn't stay long.

The day after that I was fine and back to normal.
## Comment #2


I received the J&J vaccine, came down with "flu like symptoms" that lasted around 12 hours; in total the shot cost me a solid day but I still consider it a positive experience.
## Comment #3


Dang, I got my J&J last month and just went home like nothing happened.  You took notes like a full fledged scientist.  Good job!
## Comment #4


Side effects mostly happen in 2-5 days and up to a month
# 49,M. CHF, diabetes, lung nodules. Vaccinated in March with no side effects.


Created: 2021-06-10 03:58:25

Due to terrible genetics and growing up in a filthy rodent infested house I have a myriad of health issues mostly surrounding my heart and lungs.

I‚Äôve had friends and family get COVID, some died, some had full recoveries, some are suffering from long haul syndrome. The fact that it adversely effected lungs and hearts so much scared the shit out of me. 

I got the Pfizer vaccine (two part) back in March and besides a sore shoulder for a few days I‚Äôve had zero side effects. I just feel safer knowing I‚Äôve done what I can to protect the weakest parts of me.

Congrats man! That‚Äôs amazing. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve avoided catching it I hope you continue to stay protected.
## Comment #2


Congratulations!!üéâ that‚Äôs so great to hear that you‚Äôre fully vaccinated. I also got the Pfizer, no issues to report. Hopefully some read your story and decide to get the vaccine as well.

# Anyone else experience rare side effects with the pfizer vaccine?


Created: 2021-06-10 13:41:45

So I just got my first dose of the pfizer vaccine yesterday and I experienced something not so normal according to everything I've seen online. Within 15 minutes of the shot, I started feeling a weird sensation crawl up my neck from the shot site. Don't really know how to describe it except it felt like pressure or tightness. By the 30 minute mark, the left side of my neck and jaw/cheek had swollen and gone numb. If anyone has had oral surgery, it felt like when you wake up from the anesthesia and your face feels heavy and mushy. The same sensation traveled down my left arm as well and made my thumb go numb. This last for about 4-5 hours before it started going away. I treated it with Tylenol/benadryl/ice. 

Has anyone had a similar experience? I'm wondering if this a mild allergic reaction to something in the vaccine? Should I get a test done? 

I am still planning on getting my second dose, bc everything seems to have cleared up/gone back to normal now. The entire area that was affected yesterday feels achy today, but that is supposed to be a normal side effect. 

Also, has anyone else had trouble sleeping? I was up all night and usually that is never a problem for me.

## Comment #1


I'm just over 24 hours since my first Pfizer dose and I had the injection on my left arm. I'm having strange effects on my left side like stiff neck, pain behind my left eye, headache, backache, things like that. I also feel a bit tired and slow at the moment.

I have work in 3 hours as well so I'm hoping to feel more alert soon.
## Comment #2


We were told to immediately tell the officials if we had any reactions at the vaccine site.
## Comment #3


After my first shot (astrazeneca though) i had a feeling like somone was pulling the hairs behind my ears and base of my neck..later went on to be neck pain at base of skull and branching to the back of my head on the side i had the shot..so perhaps it does happen on some very very rare level?? üòÖ my dr looked at me like i was bananas when i mentioned it ofc
## Comment #4


On the day of the shot I had a few weird sensations on the left side of my body and my left arm had at least 2 episodes of going partially numb (one minutes after injection and one a bit under an hour after) but in the next days nothing other than a sore muscle the next day and then yesterday and today it feels like I have a bruise around the injection site but nothing visually off. Hurts slightly if I apply pressure. Barely noticeable today it will probably be almost completely gone tomorrow. I don't think I felt any tightness or pressure ever but as I said I did feel some tingling on the left side of my neck in the hour or so post getting it. This is all about 1st shot btw.
# Got my second shot. Feel nothing twice.


Created: 2021-06-10 15:17:37

Other then being kinda sleepy today I‚Äôve been feeling fine. Had Pfizer twice. 

I also had covid couple months back and again felt not much. Just a headache. Good experience so far.

# Update - Myocarditis [21M, Pfizer 2, USA]


Created: 2021-06-09 19:05:02

Original Post - [https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nm6p6l/my\_story\_m21\_pfizer\_2\_usa\_myocarditis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nm6p6l/my_story_m21_pfizer_2_usa_myocarditis/) 

A little over two weeks ago, I was hospitalized for myocarditis. This occurred right after I had the second Pfizer dose. At just around that time, people began investigating the links between myocarditis and the second Pfizer vaccine. I documented my experience there up until I was discharged from the hospital, and thought I would provide an update. 

The goal of myocarditis recovery is to reduce inflammation of the heart. For any muscle, inflammation just goes away by limiting the use of that muscle. Of course, one cannot simply stop using their heart for a few days, but I took extra precautions to limit the use of my heart. I spent a few days in bed or on a couch watching TV/YouTube and playing games that I knew would not raise my heart (not Rocket League). After a few days of this, I went to see a doctor for a follow-up EKG, and then two days after that I had a follow-up echocardiogram. 

As the EKG was normal, I was able to resume normal activities, minus anything that would put additional strain on my heart. For about a week and a half, I avoided heavy physical exercise, horror movies, and alcohol. I was also, generally, taking it easy. Luckily, I am on summer break from college and live with my parents, so I did not have any external stressors. As of today, after analysis of my echocardiogram, I am fully cleared for everything. I will still probably take it easy until my internship starts in July, but it seems like my myocarditis will not cause any negative long-term effects on my heart. 

Overall, it seems like my experience with myocarditis is quite similar to others who get it not as badly. This article ([https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/05/what-its-like-to-have-myocarditis-after-covid-19-vaccine.html](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/05/what-its-like-to-have-myocarditis-after-covid-19-vaccine.html)) appears to very closely relate to my story. If anyone has any questions about my story, feel free to ask!

## Comment #1


Thanks for sharing this and the article, it sounds like quite an ordeal you went through. I have a few questions:


1. how bad was the pain?  Ive had chest pain in the past and at times I thought that this was it.

2. Did you also get heart palpitations or a fast heart rate or was chest pain your only symptom?

3. If you could go back in time, knowing that you would develop myocarditis from the vaccine, would you still take the vaccine? Would you wait for more info from the CDC? Would you take an adenovirus vaccine instead?
## Comment #2


Glad you‚Äôre ok. It can be very serious. 

Has the occurrence been reported through the appropriate channels to ensure it is investigated in relation to the vaccine?
## Comment #3


Did your pain/breathlessness get worse with exercise?

I‚Äôve been having sharp pains in my chest beginning three weeks after my second dose of Pfizer. It‚Äôs very off/on, and it NEVER happens during exercise. Only after‚Ä¶ Mostly at rest.

I‚Äôve also been having a few palpitations per day.
## Comment #4


Awesome, glad to hear you're recovered!
## Comment #5


Glad to hear you are getting better. A question: is your myocarditis considered "cured", or you were just given medicine to take to lessen the strain it put on your heart, and you are expected to be taking it for a considerable time ?

On the personal note: after weeks of following this subreddit, I am scratching my head thinking - how TF we got to the point where people are actively being encouraged to take a vaccine, and if particular person is unlucky enough to deal with serious side effects, all the people can offer is "oh well... hope you get better soon" or "it's lesser evil" or "benefits outweight the risks" ?  
Unlucky people are actively affected by vaccine to the same level an illness would affect them, and people consider that a good thing ? I thought in 21st century we would be advanced enough to avoid this kind of problems.

And for the record: I am taking a medication for heart palpitations / Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). It is not patological (*Edit: Not at this time...*), but it used to be annoying enough to cause me a great deal of anxiety. It looks like this will be a lifetime treatment, and risking the actual myocarditis on top of this problem is a reason for me to avoid vaccine at all costs.
## Comment #6


I've been reading about this on this thread. I'm scared about 2nd dose now
## Comment #7


Thanks for updating. Thank your lucky stars you didn't and probably won't now contract covid. The myocarditis rate for covid-positive people in your specific demographic is astounding. So basically you ended up with the lesser of two evils so I'd count that as a win. I hope you continue to heal.
## Comment #8


Thank you for sharing. I‚Äôm sorry this has happened to you! I got Covid in October and just got first Moderna shot. It‚Äôs been almost a week and I still have chest pain in my heart area. I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôs myocarditis! My dr said to wait w few days more before testing it. There go my universal studio plans for my birthday in august...no more rollercoasters for me...;-; 

Longhaul Covid sucked and took me 7 months to feel better. But fuck, myocarditis sounds pretty scary too! I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm gonna get the second dose. I don‚Äôt think my heart could tolerate it.
## Comment #9


I got vaccinated with Pfizer 1st dose 2 days ago. My heart is beating like crazy, i thought it was just anxiety or something. But now I'm a little bit worried.
# Help, strong side effects from 2nd Pfizer dose, due to travel tomorrow


Created: 2021-06-10 10:43:24

Hello Stella again. Posted yesterday a few hours after receiving my 2nd dose (Pfizer). This time around it was BAD and still is as I type this. I can't seem to be getting better.

Yesterday had ups and downs, in the evening I felt better and I even packed my stuff (moving apartment next week) but crap got real at nighttime. I think I had a high fever (don't have a thermometer) I was hot the whole night, felt like burning in the flames of hell. My hands and feet were cold. I didn't sleep; I kept shifting in and out of consciousness, I started being delirious like hearing things as well at some point. Had palpitation/anxiety feeling which kept waking me up from that delirious state. At 3 am then the bloody sun came out (I live in Sweden, the country where there isn't much sleep in the summertime) and I struggled to fall back asleep. Got up to close the door in a bid to block some of the light coming in, and I started shivering.

Fell asleep (if you can all it like that) and kept waking up. I also had fasciculations (muscle twitches) all over my legs the ENTIRE night and they were quite strong. First both legs, then only one. Now they come on and off occasionally. Had also the feeling of something crawling on my skin (paresthesia I think it's called) . 

Could NOT move my arm yesterday at all but pain is getting better now. I have pains in my abdomen and all over my body, I have to hold myself against the wall to walk around. 

I pushed myself out of bad at 10am when I needed to start working and I can't keep my eyes open, I feel hot, I have a headache and nausea on and off. I didn't eat at all. I keep having to go from the desk to the bed every hour or so. I am terrified not because of the effect but because they are preventing me from doing stuff and I am busy. I am due to fly (internally) for a long weekend trip where I will also be behind the wheel for the first time in years. I don't know what to do and I am quite literally freaking out and struggling to do even the smallest and easiest thing. I am worried because I have symptoms associated to the nervous system and this is what is making me freak out.

## Comment #1


This is how I felt after my second shot as well. It took a couple of days to start feeling normal again
## Comment #2


Stop trying to work and sleep! For most people, they only feel bad the day after the second shot. If you keep trying to do other stuff, odds are you will feel worse tomorrow. Drink water and electrolytes and rest. You got a bad nights sleep last night so your body is not rested, try again as much as possible today.
## Comment #3


Well freaking out isn‚Äôt going to help things. You‚Äôre having normal side effects, which can take a couple of days to resolve. Take some pain reliever, stay hydrated, and rest as much as you can.
# Constant headaches


Created: 2021-06-10 15:50:00

Just an update. One month of constant headaches, no relief with OTC meds.

CT was normal. 
Xray ruled out sinus infection
Bloodwork all in healthy ranges 
Amitriptyline 10mg helps with the pain,still a lot of pressure felt

Not sure what the next step is from here.
