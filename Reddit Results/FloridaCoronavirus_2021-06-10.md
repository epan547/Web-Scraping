## Comment #1


Welp, it's been a fun year doing the reports for the sub. At least I stuck to it until the end. There were some people posting the data at the same time as I did when I first started at it but over time they stopped posting it in the submissions or comments.
## Comment #2


Yesterday, we had the most new cases in America.  Yet, we are the first state in the nation to stop daily reports.  110% Politically Motivated.
## Comment #3


I’m a Florida tax payer, and I want to see the public health data Florida is collecting.
## Comment #4


Thank you for your reliability in keeping us updated on the daily numbers. It has been an important source of information for me during all the confusion around the pandemic. I truly appreciate all you’ve done! ❤️
## Comment #5


Seriously?! If you have nothing to hide then what is the harm in releasing data in a major pandemic that IS NOT OVER YET!! Oh wait, yes they are hiding data. They have been hiding data. And la de dah most Floridians are done with this. I wouldn’t care except my kids are still not vaccinated and I can’t leave this god awful state right now thanks to the atrocious housing market. Pls let’s get rid of DeSantis so Florida can stop being such a backwards laughingstock of the nation.
## Comment #6


That's some bullsh*t for sure.
## Comment #7


Bring out the victory banner.  I’m sure the GOP has it stashed away for an occasion like this.
## Comment #8


With any luck, this will quietly reduce the morons that think this is the best idea.
## Comment #9


Cue Ron doing his tv conferences with a bunch of smarmy suits behind him one-upping applauding anything he says. This state is being driven into the ground with him at the helm.
## Comment #10


What. The. Fuck. 

If cases were going to start going up, it'd literally be NOW.  We at the very least need to see that this is not happening as we go into the summer to feel confident about the decline we've been seeing.  This is some serious shady bullshit.  There is no good reason to not share this data. 

Are there other means of compiling and finding out how we are doing as a state?
## Comment #11


Are we the first state to stop daily reporting?
## Comment #12


What. No. This is terrible.
## Comment #13


There are well run states w less than 1% cases, of course he wants everyone to forget we are 3-4% daily still!
## Comment #14


SUNSHINE STATE???   What Sunshine State.   We are now the STATE OF DARKNESS.  Good bye SUNSHINE LAWS.

## Comment #15


So weird that this happened the day after articles popped us saying 'rona deathsentence was going to base his reelection campaign on how he handled covid.
## Comment #16


That asshole.
## Comment #17


Great. Back to my cave and not seeing anyone because there’s no information by which to judge the risk to my son who’s too young to be vaccinated. 

Piss off DeSantis. This is the worst.
## Comment #18


are counties going to still keep their dashboards going? without the state data source, shouldn't the county be able to report what they know as well?

I'm really hoping within a week, the big county health departments can figure it out and make a new dashboard for the collective counties that want to keep reporting.
## Comment #19


Thanks for your diligent efforts in keeping us apprised.  Sad to hear Florida is the first state in the nation to stop reporting their daily COVID numbers.   Well, now you can enjoy that extra bit of time you'll have now!   Take good care, kind watchman!
## Comment #20


Stopping testing couldn't get the numbers low enough so he just cuts out all reporting.
## Comment #21


Strong work all year.

Hey, y’all show this guy some love on his patreon for all the hard work he’s put in this past year. It’s in his profile. Maybe even sub to his YouTube channel, he’s got a ton of content on there.
## Comment #22


So like nothing… not weekly at least? 

God are we screwed.
## Comment #23


What the @&$&@?!!&@!
## Comment #24


How is this information even his to govern? who pays for it? Is everyone compiling this info fired now?
## Comment #25


He had a woman arrested in front of her children for trying to get accurate data out to the public. This isn't surprising. DeathSentence is a sack of shit.
## Comment #26


Thank you for all your efforts.  Your reporting really helped us understand the data.
## Comment #27


How am I supposed to live my life like a normal person if I don’t know how many people have died from a specific virus each day? The horror, the pure horror
## Comment #28


As someone not from Florida - it does not give me a lot of confidence to come visit if your state fails to report basic public health information on a timely basis for highly contagious diseases. I would contact Disney and other tourist destinations and tell them to crack the whip.

## Comment #1


I notice some people don't know about the new names. So this post will help to know which Greek Name goes to which variant so there will not be any confusion about the variant's names. Like someone, people will think the Delta variant is a new one but it's the Indian variant.

Source for the official names:  [https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/](https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/)

### Variants of Concern

# FL has cut back on COVID data to the public, but you can still get daily info from the feds

## Comment #1


Here's all you need to do:  
  
1. Go to CDC Daily Tracker: [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends\_dailytrendscases](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendscases)  
  
2. Pick Florida  
  
3. Pick Daily Cases for left axis  
  
4. Pick whatever you want for right axis. (I like total cases per 100,000)  
  
5. Pick the date range you want displayed.  
  
This gives at least a decent idea of what's happening day to day in Florida, even if the data is a day late.  
  
For example, Florida saw 1,184 new cases on June 7, 2021. Florida saw 1,590 new cases on June 8, 2021.
## Comment #2


Of course Florida is the absolute worse case state with 13,500 new cases in the past week.

## Comment #1


> Scientists took blood from volunteers who had received the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine and looked at the levels of neutralizing antibodies, the kind that prevent a virus from entering cells.
> 
> "What we showed is that the neutralizing antibodies are reduced about fivefold to the B.1.351 variant," says Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. Under the new nomenclature proposed by the World Health Organization, B.1.351 is now called Beta. It first appeared in South Africa.
> 
> "That's very similar to what other investigators have shown with other vaccines," he says. "But what we also showed is that there's many other types of immune responses other than neutralizing antibodies, including binding antibodies, FC functional antibodies and T-cell responses."

Good news against Beta variant.

No mention of the Delta variant.
## Comment #2


Umbrella is that you?
## Comment #3


In case anyone was wondering like I was:

‘Sette's lab has had similar results with the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. So has Marcela Maus at Massachusetts General Hospital. Although it will take studies in people to be certain the vaccines will work against variants, "Anything that generates a T-cell immune response to the SARS-CoV-2, I would say has promise as being potentially protective," Maus says.’
## Comment #4


Too bad nobody's interested in getting vaccinated.

well duh,  that is stating the obvious.   Curbing the exponential spread of the virus is literally the most important thing to do.

Here is a link to what seems to be the actual report:

And by ‘looser’ you mean Florida did nothing at all
## Comment #4


This study uses GDP to assess the economic performance. Wealth inequality has increased greatly during this pandemic, but hey, the total numbers are better, right?. The tech companies and the wealthy benefited **greatly**. A massive shift in wealth brought about by shutting down local businesses around the country/world and people being forced to concentrate revenue in mega corporations. It's shocking California and other states could benefit from extracting wealth from the rest of the country.

The world where "libs" don't care about that so much as long as it owns the "cons". For people that don't like either team wrestling for the political football, it gets old seeing the QAnon/BlueAnon types fight it out.
## Comment #5


As a FL resident who still had money to spend during the pandemic, I know I didn't feel like going out and spending it with the lax restrictions in place in FL.   I still don't want to go into crowded places such as indoor restaurants, despite being vaccinated.   The only place I will eat is outdoor restaurants.   And now the weather is getting too warm to even do that.  

I did finally go visit my son in CA a week ago.   There I felt more comfortable sitting in a restaurant.  They have higher vaccination rates.   Masking still required unless sitting and eating.  Windows and doors were open.   Tables were well spread.  Servers masked. 

DeSantis's approach to force the end to mask mandates and not stress vaccination rates enough are not helpful for the Florida economy.  I know people from other states who refuse to visit here because we can't get out shit under control.  And now with only weekly reporting we are hiding it even more.

## Comment #10


I'm Floridian. Our Governor sucks. We did better than expected still due to our hot wearher year round and due to the lockdowns imposed by our local City and County Mayors in the 3 largest Counties. Yet, a ton of ppl died, refrigerated trucks lined up behind our largest hospitals, and the death count underreported by DeSantis. He fired the scientist who refused to fake the numbers of deaths. The worst  w Covid is over for now. But, we did have strict lockdowns at City levels.... but Governor DeSantis has faint memory cuz doesnt fit the GOP narrative 😃
## Comment #11


Duh.  Florida’s main economy is tourism…which virtually shut down during COVID. The reason has nothing to do with Florida having “looser” COVID restrictions.

This is another political misinformation article posted on this subreddit pretending to be devoted to Coronavirus.

According to [the report from UCLA](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/anderson-forecast-expects-economic-recovery-spring-2021):

**Florida is in full employment but California will not reach this level until 2023!** California was devastated by covid policy and Florida saved by covid policy.

>” In California, “sectors with a high degree of human contact” — that is, “leisure and hospitality, education, retail trade, and health care and social services” — contributed only “0.3 percentage points to annual GDP growth over the decade preceding the pandemic.” But last year, “they accounted for 75 percent of the state’s job losses

**The idiot who wrote the article didn't consider what the above means for Florida. Florida retail plus edhealth plus leisure comprises 19% of FLGDP not 11% like CA**

https://www.statista.com/statistics/304903/florida-real-gdp-by-industry/

The stupid policy in CA devastated California, except rich whites who run the narrative there. They don't care about that 75% of unemployed. In FL, it would have had twice the impact since we are twice as invested in these sectors than CA. Health is a leading growth sector here. I couldn't do the math on % contributed to growth over the last decade, but FL has probably grown more in tourism and hhs, being a tourist state and top obamacare state in US.

**California GDP at 1.8% growth and FL at 5.7% speaks volumes no matter what segments you are looking at.**

Does anyone still feel the claims of superior economic recovery in CA to that of FL is even in the ballpark of realism?
## Comment #16


Why are people leaving that state?
## Comment #17


So if California is doing such a good job, Why is the governor being recalled?
## Comment #18


I always found it ironic that our state’s pandemic economic plan relied on telling seniors holding all of the wealth to stay home because we can’t guarantee any sort of safety in public places while expecting college students to prop up the economy.
## Comment #19


The party of feels over reals doesn't really care what the data shows.
## Comment #20


Imagine that! What a shock!
## Comment #21


California closed down schools, makes it harder for working parents to return to work force. Florida did not, and was pretty much the national leader in returning students to classrooms. 

California also was aggressive in forbidding outdoor activities. Localities banned even outdoor dining for parts of 2020, forbid outdoor group exercise, all activities that are low risk to no risk for COVID. The slow and hesitant adoption of outdoor being safe, probably had to hurt businesses.

## Comment #3


She doesn't live in Florida any longer, so how would that even work

Edit: Looking at her instagram, she was using hyperbole to point out the hypocrisy of DeSantis
applauding her twitter ban while also passing law that forbids social media to ban people. Or something. Maybe. Ugh.
## Comment #4


I'm going to start hoarding mud because there's not enough for how much they'll be slinging. 

What a shit show.
## Comment #5


Oh come on, let's not sink to the alt-right's levels and start running a clown show of candidates.

We can produce much better candidates to run against DeathSantis and Gaetz, unknowns are actually far better surprises, they couldn't find much to throw against Obama (not that they didn't try, remember when they had to settle for attacking his church preacher and not his own policies).
## Comment #6


Good luck, but this state is too stupid and corrupted for her to win..
## Comment #7


I mean, can we please just have some decent candidates? This is just embarrassing :/
## Comment #8


Matt Gaetz is not running again.  That's why he's been fishing for jobs.

The Republicans will nominate someone else who will win, and I doubt Jones will even win the primary.

Good for her! We need to get rid of that guy! He is garbage.
## Comment #14


How does being a data scientist qualify someone to hold office?  Her background is scientific studies of hurricanes according to her website.  Even if all of her claims are true.. why run for Congress?
## Comment #15


People like her never make it in politics.  You know, people with integrity, accountability and that ridiculous notion of honesty.
## Comment #16


Whatever she can do to garner more attention no doubt.
## Comment #17


We need someone strong to run against DeSantis.  He has definitely been gearing up for a presidential run for a while.

Yay PBC!
## Comment #2


>The health director said she expects to see "small increases" in cases around the July 4th holiday, as well as the holiday season later in the year, but nothing of major concern.

>"Little bumps along the road, but not sustained curve going straight up because of the vaccinations and what a great job we have been doing with vaccines across the entire state of Florida," Alonso said.

Nice seeing public health officials have such positive outlooks for the year.

>In an effort to vaccinate as many people as possible, the Palm Beach County health department is deploying mobile vaccination units to businesses, churches, community organizations, and homebound residents.

And good on them for this. Programs like this should have been much more common during the process.
# 6/6/2021 Urgent Care Report


Created: 2021-06-07 23:01:19

We're still seeing positive COVID cases. These people are not asymptomatic carriers. They are violently ill people who came to us because they couldn't bear it any longer. That means that there are asymptomatic cases that are not being found. 

We are still testing people who were exposed to positive cases. All these people (adults) get a rapid test, but children wishing to go to school must have a lab test. I'm not made aware of lab results, just rapids. Rapid testing often misses cases. It's just that some people don't have enough virus in their body (nostrils) for it to show up. Lab tests are a little better. Just a little. 

*Numerous* symptomatic patients were discharged with "RSV" again. They tested negative but have all the signs and symptoms. Instructions sent with them tell them to quarantine, treat symptomatically, and make every attempt not to infect others. Should they become more Ill they should return for treatment or go to the ER. 

Alarming trend: Seniors discovering sudden health issues. Many cannot get quick appointments with their PCPs, all are afraid of the hospital ("There's COvididium there!") If you fall, have chest pain, trouble breathing, don't have refills for prescriptions (no insulin, etc.), discover lumps...GET HELP ASAP. The ER is there for a reason! 

Non-Alarming but Weird: Numerous twisted ankles, broken feet, broken arms and hands. These are all due to outdoor activities...If you are out and about, wear sturdy shoes, be aware that grassy areas may contain dips or holes, and keep aware of your surroundings. 

Last note: Despite what DeSantis thinks, the pandemic is *not* over. Get your vaccination quickly. 
Britain is experiencing a resurgence of Delta (Indian variant) and that variant is slowly rising in the Southeastern States (is: Georgia and Florida.) 

If our small clinic has seen just 4 symptomatic  positive cases a day, that's 28 positive cases roaming in our small town...and that's the way it started ... Remember?

## Comment #2


I’m in Florida and I just got over a weird illness with a sore throat and cough. I’m fully vaccinated. I had these same symptoms just before the pandemic started and thought maybe I’d had it already. This time I got tested but was negative so there is definitely a bug of some kind going around that isn’t the C word.
## Comment #3


I love your on the scene reports
## Comment #4


Always appreciate your posts!

Is anyone you're seeing with symptoms vaccinated? Any of the RSV people, or does the hospital ask?
## Comment #5


>If you are out and about, wear sturdy shoes

Clutch advice.  Really.  I've seen so many people have to get amputations because they didn't wear shoes outside and then didn't get a cut looked at for weeks.
## Comment #6


I hope you don’t mind if I chime in. I find this field type reporting more helpful than the convoluted numbers provided but the state. So thanks for doing this. I have a friend that works at a major hospital here in NE Florida. They currently have 9 hospitalizations. This is a slight uptick from a few weeks ago. However last month at this time, they had double that number of covid inpatients including more cases in the ICU. So general trend is good.
