Consumer confidence is what impacts local spending. Restaurants didn't start losing business because people had to wear masks, it's because they were afraid they would get the virus and die or kill someone they love or have to stay indoors for 2 weeks. Consumer's who believe their government is prioritizing their safety are more likely to take unnecessary risk, aka go out during a pandemic and spend.
## Comment #3


Well, those states have also always done better than the flyover states.
## Comment #4


They scream capitalism but not market confidence i think that's the big difference here. Along with all the other nut job nonsense that goes along with it.
## Comment #5


Can anyone find a direct link to the study? I‚Äôm having a hard time finding the actual numbers.
## Comment #6


Obviously lol
## Comment #7


A lot of Red Spreadneck states are also states with small populations and non big cities within their borders. Other then Texas, Florida, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, the Carolinas, Idaho, and the Dakotas as well as the spreadneck southern craker states, that's about it!!

# I got into a telegram group called The White Rose.... 22,009 Covidiots organizing rallies and purchasing printers to spread misinformation. If this stuff annoys you too, help me report a group called ‚ÄúLearn the Risk‚Äù on Facebook and Instagram.

18 months into a pandemic, millions dead, and people still think it's a hoax
## Comment #3


I keep seeing the stickers everywhere. Although it makes me feel better to see that group only has 25k members. Still 25k too many, but it could be worse.
## Comment #4


What makes me really angry is the name of that group. Who are they to compare themselfes to the white rose? Those kids died for resisting the nazi regime and nowadays disgusting fuckers like the people in this telegram group are out here putting dirt on their name. I hope hell has a nice special little place near the boiler room set aside for 25.8k absolute  pieces of shit
## Comment #5


"The Earth is flat too, right? - moron"
## Comment #6


Is this brother sponsored content or what the fuck?
## Comment #7


Fuck these people for comparing themselves to resistance fighters that literally fucking died fighting against Nazi ideology.
## Comment #8


I do agree with the second sticker.
## Comment #9


you guys are lesser with everyday,the last stupids on reddit!!

I've made a lot of my life decisions based upon signs on the top of RVs.
## Comment #4


They are doing everyone a public service to be honest, advertising their stupidity and the fact that they are not vaccinated...
## Comment #5


We laugh at them now, but in a couple years this person might sacrifice themselves to save us from an alien invasion.

The website is hilariously terrible too. Like made by a drunk kindergartener bad.

I saw a truck with similar crazy messages all over the place, also parked in a Walmart in upstate NY. 

Seems like Walmart is a common theme with these morons

Welllllll.... That's three pages of undiluted crazy.
## Comment #3


Is this not like undeniable mental illness? Pure delusion? 

I want them to get help ... they very much need it
## Comment #4


I'd report it. The last page could be construed as a threat from the "Queen of Canada".  This person clearly needs help.
## Comment #5


This has real ‚ÄúI declare bankruptcy!‚Äù energy.

I wasn't zoomed in enough and read the name as Roman Dildo.

I really enjoyed this internet rabbit hole during my insomnia. I learnt about vaccines, body doubles, and how her name can be rearranged to spell "I AM OUR DONALD" (which I think they think is a good thing?)

I'm pretty sure that we in the US own the copyright for "We The People" so President Trump is going to have to declare war on Canada and her highness HR Pufnstuf Romancandle.

Biden is not really president... Damnnnn.
## Comment #12


This has the same underinformed, futile vibes as middle schoolers getting into Kony2012, but way less righteous.
## Comment #13


Lol.  What a fucktard.
## Comment #14


Wouldn't circulation of these documents br some type of crime? Not sure how it works in Canada but where i'm from this would certainly get you jail time.
## Comment #15


That looks like a job for the police or even secret service. Sounds like people want to overthrow your guberment.
## Comment #16


I'm starting to think they're trolling.
## Comment #17


It's invalid because they failed to say, "I Hereby Declare".   


And as a side note, "Romana Didulo" can be rearranged to spell "U A Roman Dildo"
## Comment #18

I fear they'll have to be quarantined from themselves.
## Comment #20


Wow that‚Äôs next level dumb
## Comment #21


Seems like Fraud and Misrepresenting yourself as a government official.  


Seems like they should see some jail time.
## Comment #22


Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.  So cringey and awful.
## Comment #23


Lmao yeah good luck making any of that stick in court. 

-"But your honor, my human rights have been violated!"

-"Yeah? Which ones specifically?"

## Comment #24


Oh man, they try so hard.
## Comment #25


Huh TIL Romana Dildo is the queen of Canada
## Comment #26


Lol queen of canada? I want whatever drugs they are using. Lmao
## Comment #27


It's from the Queen of Canada, looks like there is nothing we can do. oh well....
## Comment #28


Get a photo of her from a security cam, and add a note saying "LOL LOOK AT THIS STUPID CUNT" to the printout.

Still not sure why people think that posting a paper with official-sounding words means they can get whatever they want.

This has the same energy as the morons claiming the non existent "medical exemption" with the placard that says we can't ask them about it because of "HIPPA" (sic).
## Comment #29


Didn't even use her own signature at the end, signed it "WethePeople" LMAO
## Comment #30


HRH Queen Lady? Sounds legit to me!
## Comment #31


She's lost some marbles I guess.

‚ÄúI though we covered this in Nuremberg‚Äù

Shaking my goddamn head off my shoulders
## Comment #4


This pandemic combined with Trumpism REALLY ripped of a scab in the United States of America and it revealed how entitled we are as a people.  It all started in infancy when Jimmy Carter had the gall to ask Americans to lower the thermostat and wear a sweater at the height of an energy crisis.  It's not much of a sacrifice, but the parents and grandparents of our current entitled said, "No, my sacrifice days for the common good are over!  You owe me Social Security, Medicare, and taxes at it about 0%!".  Then Reagan gave them all ice cream and they just ate it up and mistook it for good governance.  It wasn't and the debt exploded.

Bush asked them to balance the budget with tax increases and the entitled revolted.  Clinton got skewered about raising taxes, but he also killed the debt and deficits the entitled gave us with responsible governance and a tech economy that blew through the roof.

Then young Bush decided to court the entitled again with massive tax cuts and simple answers like attacking Iraq for something his intel officers said a guy in a cave in Pakistan did.  Fear is like fuel for the entitled and they ran with their prejudices for the next two decades on anything dark, including the President of the United States from 2009-2017.  

Trump was the dream candidate for these 2 and half generations of entitled who regressed educationally since New Federalism and servicing the entitled became a thing.  The pandemic put a brighter light on their moronic worldview forged over 40 years.  The slightest sacrifice like a common sense mask and getting a vaccine were an intrusion on their "rights".  Sacrifice and compromise are four letter words to these people.

Assholes...all of them.
## Comment #5


Wtf does Nuremberg have to do with any of this?
## Comment #6


I will never understand how public health measures is viewed in the same vein as other personal freedoms.  Like the ability to go to any store you want and buy whatever brand of milk you like is the same as putting on a mask to keep from killing a stranger at that store with a preventable disease.  How is this even a discussion?
## Comment #7


‚ÄúWearing a mask is FASCISM! Also, let‚Äôs get rid of democracy and bring Trump back with undisputed power, executing anyone we don‚Äôt like along the way through police enforcement!‚Äù
## Comment #8


That lady looks like she's had a few venereal diseases over time.
## Comment #9


I work for the medical examiners office. It is my job to pick up bodies. I pick up corona deaths all the time. I‚Äôm so fucking sick of people not taking this seriously.

What would a biochemical internet connection even do?   


You're telling me they can biochemically connect me to the net and then what? send a digital signal to my amino acids that falls deaf with it's inability to do absolutely anything? Are my thoughts somehow now translated in a way humans can process through the internet? Did they implant a neurotranslator with this internet connection? If so, and they can do that all in a couple fluid ounces why the hell can't we get that same tech for the same price in any electronic that has ever existed?
