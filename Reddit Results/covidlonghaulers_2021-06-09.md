# Suicide Prevention and Support thread

## Comment #1


I read prolonged shortness of breath/hypoxia increases someones risk of suicide by 4x. I had continuous shortness of breath for 6 months. Anyone struggling with sob: it can get better dont give up!
## Comment #2


The US hotline is for anyone feeling down. So not just when we are at crisis level. 
Reach out.

Many times we get to the point that we can’t see clearly that we need help.  Make a plan with supportive family or friends to get you help when it is needed. 

COVID messes with the mind so we need to be extra watchful for this. The neuro-inflammation is no joke.

We also need to be very aware of the medications we are all trying, SSRIs, Steroids, Ivermectin, Mood Stabilizers, Anti-Seizure meds, Singulair, etc.

While they can be helpful they also can contribute to depression or even psychosis.
Watch as you go on these meds, have supportive family/friends watch as well. 

Most importantly:
Please reach out. You are needed. 
We need you. Please hang on.
## Comment #3


Do you seriously believe those hotlines are of any help for our situation?
## Comment #4


I wish I had COVID instead of what I have.
Fuck this world
# In case you missed it: antihistamines proven effective in small study

## Comment #1


**Please read this disclaimer:**

Always check with your physicians before starting any medications or supplements to prevent possible medication/diet interactions (which could sometimes be very dangerous). Drug/supplement interactions are no joke and could be deadly.

It is not recommended to take Pepcid (famotidine) daily for a period longer than 2 weeks unless you’re told otherwise and monitored by your physician. Long term use of medications like famotidine (especially something like Pepcid complete - which has added calcium carbonate) could result in several different issues, primarily one called metabolic alkalosis, which could land you in the hospital with severe neurological problems. 

Although Claritin (loratidine) is generally well tolerated  for daily and long term use, still mention it to your Physician so they are aware of you using it.

Please note that this study is not peer reviewed (looked over by accredited individuals to determine the merit/reliability of the study) and has a very small sample size (meaning it is possible that the group of subjects was too small to represent a larger population; thus potentially making the results insignificant). Once again, please speak to your doctor before beginning a new medication regiment.
## Comment #2


40mg famotidine at once? My pills are 10 mg so I'd have to take four a day at once? That sounds like too much? 26 days to see a difference is interesting. I've tried them but never took more than a few days before deciding it didn't help
## Comment #3


H1+H2 blockers definitely helped the first few months. But even before six months did not need them anymore.

BTW claritin is the weakest of the H1 blockers

These are the modern H1 blockers from strongest to weakest

*    desloratadine (Clarinex, Aerius)
*    levocetirizine (Xyzal)
*    cetirizine (Zyrtec)
*    fexofenadine (Allegra)
*    terfenadine (Seldane)
*    loratadine (Claritin)

I personally found Xyzal very powerful, even more than Zyrtec and great before bed.

diphenhydramine (Benadryl) was the 1st generation H1 but not advised because it's an anticholinergic and now you've got 2 problems

Just a strong warning that 40mg of Pepcid is going to slow your digestive system to a crawl. I found that supplements that normally took minutes to start working would then take hours.
## Comment #4


I’ve been taking 10mg Zyrtec and 10mg Pepcid for 3.5 months straight now.  I feel these have been critical to my recovery, and were some of the first successful treatments that took me from bed ridden to walking zombie.
## Comment #5


Famotidine once daily, and larotidine twice. 
Wouldn't that be the other way around? Claritin package mentions at most once daily.
## Comment #6


Before you guys all get ripped off...

You can buy bottles of these drugs, hundreds of pills, for a few dollars on Amazon or the like. 

Drug store prices plus buying the name brand is an **INSANE** rip off. Like 10 to 20x the cost for the exact same thing. Walgreens has 300 zyrtec generic pills for $12. The name brand ones are 30 pills (yes 30) for $18.
## Comment #7


I feel they have helped me and it took a low histamine diet and these tablets about 6 weeks to have an effect. Since then I have slowed them down a little. Taking them every other day with no problems so far.
## Comment #8


Also mirtazapine is an antidepressant that is antihistaminic.
## Comment #9


I've been taking zyrtec daily for 15 years, so that hasn't helped me with my long covid. It helped with my allergies and they make me feel worst but there are a ton of people who take that regularly already.
## Comment #10


> Patients reported improvements in all symptoms except dysautonomia.

Aren't antihistamines sometimes prescribed **for** dysautonomia? That would make it unexpected.
## Comment #11


Thank you for sharing!
## Comment #12


Thanks for the link, but I was already taking famotidine daily before I got covid, my doctor bumped it up from 10mg twice a day to 20mg twice a day over a year ago and I've had horrible LC symptoms for 16 months. Maybe I would have been much sicker without it but it wasn't a cure for me. In fact, I weaned mostly off of it over the last month without much change. I've heard it isn't good to be on long term and also wanted to see how bad my GERD is now- it is better than it was, but I think a lot of that is because I'm usually very careful about what & when I eat now.

I guess I could try the protocol combining it with the cetirizine or loratidine but I'm really not supposed to take those (glaucoma). I should check with my eye doctor...
## Comment #13


I did an elimination diet and figured out histamine was the problem. But what were not talking about here is support DAO "Diamine oxidase (DAO) is a digestive enzyme produced in your kidneys, thymus, and the intestinal lining of your digestive tract."

COVID seems to have affected most of our guts.

## Comment #14


They've helped me, but it took some time to kick in. Give them time, also take them twice a day just as mentioned.  You may need to cycle between claritin, allegra, xyzal, etc to find one that works for you
# 6 month wait for post covid clinic appointment yesterday.... and.... drumroll...

## Comment #1


COVID and long-haul are still very new, and doctors are generally not prone to experimenting on patients. My advice to anyone prepping for any doctor appointment is to bring your own homework. Print out a few relevant (quality) studies and articles and have a plan of what you want to discuss.

At the same time, you can’t just demand tests that you want or insist on certain theories. It’s a fine line to walk - you want to encourage a collaborative relationship without coming across as over-anxious or demanding. My experience is that usually a doctor will at least hear you out, because they are seeking new knowledge as well.

Remember that doctors *want* to help but they are foremost clinicians, not researchers, even at a specialized office. Also remember that spending hours down an internet rabbit-hole does not make you an expert either. Doctors are (rightfully) skeptical when patients come in acting like they already know better. Medical training still matters, and the goal is to take advantage of their expertise to arrive at answers.
## Comment #2


Public health officials and most doctors have failed miserably during this pandemic. It’s like doctors are more interested in checking boxes than finding solutions.
## Comment #3


Sorry to hear that. I'm getting ready for my clinic visit in about a week. Tempering my expectations.
## Comment #4


I think it’s say more that his original doctor is a good doctor! The doctor is on point how to treat his condition, the doc is up to date.
## Comment #5


So sorry it was shit. But yeah, not surprising is it?
## Comment #6


LOL i just had the same experience. You can read about it in my post history. Mine can't even refer me to specialists within the university hospital because most of them don't accept my insurance. I got an appointment with a PCP who ordered some blood work...and that was basically it. 

The clinics like Mount Sinai in New York seem to be the gold standard, with everything integrated into a one stop shop. They get alot of attention but seem to be exceptions. Most call themselves clinics but are really just a PCP and really nothing more, especially if you have HMO, Medicare, etc. Apparently you and I are stuck with the latter.

My theory is that these are research operations disguised as rehabilitation operations. People are probably more open to being observed like lab guinea pigs when they're made to believe that the clinic offers some new or innovative treatment that most standard PCP's don't have access to. Certainly was the case in my experience. So the disappointment after my initial visit was overwhelming. 

I definitely feel for you...

# The four most urgent questions about long COVID

## Comment #1


This is a highly comprehensive article and well worth reading (brain fog permitting). The 4 questions highlighted below: 

**- How many people get long COVID and who is most at risk?**

**- What is the underlying biology of long COVID?**

**- What is the relationship between long COVID and other post-infection syndromes?**


**- What can be done to help people with long COVID**
## Comment #2


Thanks for sharing this!! I really enjoyed reading it. It helps me feel hopeful to read about the different approaches to learning more about what we're going through. 

Ive been wondering if the way long-haul folks are responding to the vaccine is connected to their symptoms and underlying health issues resulting from Covid. 

For instance, the vaccine could address some of the viral persistace found in some and result in improvement of symptoms, but for folks whose symptoms are the result of inflamation the vaccine could have a degneritive effect. 

I look forward to reading studys that correlate these these factors.
## Comment #3


>Finally, there is the question of what part COVID-19 vaccines might play. Although many of them prevent death and severe illness, scientists do not yet know whether they prevent long COVID.

This is an afterthought in the article and not even included in their list of urgent questions. I really don’t understand why it isn’t more prominent. We don’t have the answer yet, and yet we are acting like vaccinated people have “minimal risk.”

Well, for me, the big risk is getting long Covid. Until that question gets answered, my KN95 mask stays on and I will continue staying away from potentially unvaccinated people.
# Upcoming conference this month on long COVID treatments.

## Comment #1


It’s stunning when you think about, but there has still been no international conference on treating COVID-19 itself. Here you have WHO being an international agency whose focus is on global public health and 18 months into a global pandemic and they still have not organized a conference on _treating_ the disease. How is that even possible?
## Comment #2


Watch out for **Ashok Gupta**. Proven charlatan!
## Comment #3


Several experts will discuss their success with using ivermectin. It is not a cure all but these experts believe it is an effective treatment for some cases.

 It is frustrating that public health agencies won’t give it preliminary approval for this purpose. It’s been used for decades for human use, not just for animals as its critics frequently claim, as an anti-parasitic, and its side effects profile is well charactized, being minor and short term.

 Given the fact the top experts in the field say it has effectiveness there is no logical reason public health agencies won’t at least give it emergency use authorization under a doctors care.

 Here is an interview with the conference lead organizer Dr. Tina Peers:

It's so lovely hearing this! Thanks for sharing, posts like these are so hopeful.
## Comment #2


Thank you! First time I’ve seen someone mention the Eustachian Tube issues, it’s been a nasty symptom since May ‘20 - pretty sure a lot of balance issues are related. Curious what meds helped with that?
## Comment #3


Thank you for your story, hope, and candid approach to your experience! Wish you the best!
## Comment #4


Thanks for posting, stay safe!
## Comment #5


I’m obviously not the boss of you, but maybe check back once a month or so and say HEY! STILL RECOVERED! HANG IN THERE!

Consider it community service? Banking some karma? Whatever. I need the hope and I need opportunities to celebrate with my unplanned brethren!
## Comment #6


Great post! Me to! I'm right there with you line for line. 

What has helped greatly is zeroing in on mitochondria dysfunction and eating foods and taking supplements to repair the mitochondria. Just Google it! There's lots of old research that they are taking another look at and applying to COVID-19 long haulers. It's working for me!
## Comment #7


Great news, I hope your upwards trajectory continues!
## Comment #8


Did all your chronic fatigue lift?
## Comment #9


Did the vaccine help a lot? Do you think so? I have been going through with something similar, just made a post on it
## Comment #10


Was your success time based or did you use meds to aid recovery?
## Comment #11


So happy for you. 

Did you change your diet? Thank you

My remaining lingering symptom is ETD which is so debilitating
## Comment #12


Im getting my first vaccine on Monday. I hope that I react well to it like many others. Sad to hear it had a bad impact on you. 

Thanks for sharing!
## Comment #13


Congratulations!
## Comment #14


Congratulations! I’m like you, got Covid March 2020 and have spent thousands on docs who have no solutions. 

My lung problems went away 3 weeks after my second Pfizer shot. My r/pots and r/raynauds has been noticeably reduced. Able to do a little more each week since the shot.
## Comment #15


Glad to hear some of us are getting a little better. I see you mention you still have ETD issues. Do you still have the tinnitus as well? I've had all the symptoms you mention but IMO the tinnitus is by far the most debilitating!
## Comment #16


What vaccine did you have?
# Was doing good, but 2 days ago had a milkshake and fast food. On day 2 of intense stomach ache :(

## Comment #1


I'm so sorry. So far I'm really not eating -- but that's no way to diet. Hope you feel better.
## Comment #2


Oh baby I’ve had to eat like the cleanest mf on the planet in order to appease my digestive system now. 

Im talking a large salad everyday (like 2 lbs of greens), boiled beans and boiled whole grains. Fresh fruit. If im not at 100 grams of fiber my body will wake me up at 5am and start purging my body of everything i ate the day before. 

On the plus though i am eating the healthiest ive ever eaten and thats helped with brain fog and other symptoms.
# How’s everyone feeling today?

## Comment #1


Nauseous. Tired. Whiny. And I hate being whiny.

That said, my doc has done a whole series of tests on me, so I know what I DON'T have. I'm grateful for knowing it isn't bowel cancer. 😊
## Comment #2


Today I'm okay. I had a relatively okay day yesterday because I took my once a week ativan which takes the edge off my depression for 5 hours. I met my friend and sister for ice cream and my friend met my new baby. I'm on a restrictive diet from weight gain from the drug I'm on mirtazapine, but I've lost 4 pounds and I ate super healthy all day to afford the kids sized ice cream.. egg custard and chocolate.. I usually can't have chocolate and I notice it actually makes me tired for some weird reason now. I had a useless 6 month wait post covid clinic yesterday, but I didn't have high expectations. Today I took a dose of Wellbutrin even though I don't think this drug is gonna work for me. I'm going to teach two girls from Honduras English later, when I go to pick up my baby.  Yesterday was pretty good relatively speaking.. so I'm okay today. The bar is low now. I'm in survival mode.
## Comment #3


I hear you. I’m a bit light headed and weak. Because I made a chopped salsa for dinner and that was too much standing apparently. I had a period of total sadness today wishing I could go back to how I was.... but then this big energy arose in my chest and I thought, no, there is no going back but it will be ok again one day. Somehow that got me through ☺️

What are you doing for fun? Got anything good on the go?
## Comment #4


I had a really good two weeks, eating normally, no GI symptoms other than some nausea. Then I threw up today 😰. I want to go home and rest but for now I’m chugging through the rest of the work day.
## Comment #5


I’m finally starting to be able to get through a work day without having to crash immediately when I get home

Also for the first time since I got covid in January, I can take a set of stairs without being winded. I’m also getting that tight chest/heart racing feeling much fewer and further in between. 

Gradual cardio improvement feels really good, but getting to where I am has been difficult (and felt so panic-y and hyperventilate-y)
## Comment #6


My physical activity threshold has been improving and I've been feeling *mostly* recovered, but over the past week my breathing has gotten bad again. Maybe related to the heat.

I was told over and over that I don't have any pulmonary problems, but this is not a normal feeling and I still don't have satisfactory answers.

Being at home all the time definitely adds a layer of crappiness to everything. It's good to get out at least once a day, even just for a short walk.

## Comment #1


thank you so much for this. came across your post while scrolling, laying in bed and crying of hopelessness and desperation. this helped me calm down a little. have a good day, so happy for u.
## Comment #2


Can you elaborate on what kind of MCAS testing you were doing and what the treatment was please? I would like to talk to my long-haul Covid clinic doctors about this more.
## Comment #3


Amazing! How long did it take for you to get to 90% recovered since starting the antihistamine medications? Can you share which antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers you took? I’ll then ask my doc about them. Thanks ! :)
## Comment #4


I’m so glad you got a diagnosis and the right help; I’m genuinely delighted for you 🙂
## Comment #5


What did you take for mast cell activation?
## Comment #6


Did u have bad fatigue hat felt like it was coming from head where it caused brain fog muscle pain and shakiness and dizziness/lightheadness in later months?  What did your intolerant to alcohol feel mine made my head go crazy and inflamed.  Like knife in my head.  I’m month 11 ans my legs are shaking and I get dizzy and lightheaded if I try to exert at all.  But fatigue didn’t start till month 6.  I dk so confused thinking I have CFS
## Comment #7


How long did it take for the antihistamines to help? Are you off of them or still taking them?
## Comment #8


My story exactly, mine started in January of 2020. Ninety eight percent healed today. What symptoms I have are now totally manageable. Like you I avoid anything that will trigger histamine and inflammatory cytokines and treat it like MCAS.
## Comment #9


Thank you for a positive post based on tangible things that have worked (I'm really over the "just think positive!" posts, ha ha, which always feel like they're blaming my illness on my not being positive enough... I literally had someone tell me I'm sick because I'm "too negative").

Very good to hear and I'm glad you're feeling better.

Edit- agh, I misspelled "you're", fuck my brain
## Comment #10


You're awesome for posting this.

How did you go about finding a "mast cell specialist"? I tried a regular immunologist and although she was very kind, this kind of syndrome seemed to be outside of her expertise.

Also did your doctor give you a prognosis? Will you have to stay on those medications forever or does the body eventually "fix" itself?
## Comment #11


Another question, I am curious if you got vaccinated or were told not to. I wonder how you would’ve handled that?
## Comment #12


so happy to hear you are feeling better! for post exertional malaise, what was that symptom like for you? for me any over exertion will give me flu like symptoms starting 2 days after the exertion. is that how it was for you? how long until it resolved?
## Comment #13


did u have PEM?
## Comment #14


I’m in pretty much the same boat as you. I can do everything but cardio and drink. And drinking is only a mild nuisance if I take antihistamines. Glad to a lot of us are getting better.
## Comment #15


Whoa, this was inspiring! I'm glad you're doing well now!

Also, may I ask, were you taking any vitamins/supplements (I'm not sure if I'm allowed for the antihistamines, though), or are doing any activities to relieve your pains?

Thank you and stay safe as well!
## Comment #16


Glad to hear you're doing better my friend. Out of curiosity, how long did it take for these treatments to start helping? Did you feel immediately better after them or did it take time?
## Comment #17


That’s terrific and thanks for coming to share your story. 
Questions;  did you get vaccine?  When you went on mcas stabilizers, who diagnosed that?  Thanks!

# How I'm feeling 10 days after climbing the volcano

## Comment #1


I feel like it has something to do with respiration. Anaerobic and Aerobic are two fairly different pathways. I haven't massively looked into it but I too have found I can walk all day then be fine but say I did 30 mins of anaerobic/running it'll kill me off the next day.
