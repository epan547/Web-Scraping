# NEW HIGH SCORE! Every day that we have a new high in cases/deaths/active/hospitalizations, this post will be sticky.


Created: 2020-10-10 16:41:32

Note: The title says that this post will stay sticky on days with new highs. Since this pandemic is not slowing and every week lately has had multiple new highs, we will leave this post sticky until we see fewer new highs.

NEW HIGH SCORE is meant to be a warning. This pandemic is one of the worst crisis that our nation and state have faced, but the lack of responsibility and total disregard for life shown by those in power have made this crisis exponentially worse. This crisis could have been mitigated, but having a President who disregards the safety of the nation over his own interests and having a Governor follows his lead have lead us to our current predicament. We should have been following science and taking the harsh but necessary steps other nations have successfully used to halt the spread of the virus. Instead, the advice of our brightest minds has largely been abandoned as the President makes a last ditch attempt to salvage his political chances. Our nation and state (Remember, we have that almighty 'Oklahoma Standard' making us different/better than the rest of the nation) should be improving, but instead we find ourselves recording record numbers so often that the news starts to become a common occurrence. Our leaders have abandoned their duty to the people over personal interests and fears. Reelection and retaining political power are the prize they seek, at the cost of a healthier and recovering population. They have proven this is a game to them.

NEW HIGH SCORE is not meant to make light of our losses, but to serve as a Scarlet Letter reminder of the failures of our leaders and a warning to those that support their inaction.

**WE WILL REMEMBER WHO FAILED US IN OUR TIME OF NEED. YOU WILL BE JUDGED AND HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY THE PEOPLE YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT AND PROTECT.**

Thanks to the inaction of Oklahoma's Governor, we have one of the worst records in the USA. Need an easy way to refer people to this list? Just tell them to type this into their browser: [www.FuckStitt.com](http://www.fuckstitt.com)
## Comment #2


When do we reach "Game Over" ... and will Stitt for brains care?
## Comment #3


10/10 also has 13893 active, so that's new high as well.
## Comment #4


Today beats yesterday's high score for daily cases. :(
## Comment #5


OESC is now gonna require people on unemployment go and look for jobs while cases are rising. They are gonna require people who make less than 50 bucks on unemployment to go out look. www.fuckstitt.com
## Comment #6


Not to be rude but if we are doing high scores I think you need to give attribution to the high scorer. JKS - John Kevin Stitt   

P.s. had to Google this, didn't realize his first name was John

## Comment #8


Is this a great state, or what?
## Comment #9


I started adding new highs for ICU patients since we are seeing a surge in those cases. I can't edit the title of the post, so just pointing out the new addition.
## Comment #10


I think each one of us need to tweet at Stitt factual Covid19 Oklahoma stats as many times per day as possible. If we keep them factual, leave out pejorative language, but still demand he does something, anything, maybe we can draw attention, put the spotlight on his failure.
## Comment #11


Another nearly 3k new cases today. I dont think they care how bad it gets, because they certainly don't act like it.
## Comment #12


it’s kinda sad on this subs part to turn human lives into a “score” 

i get the point, but remember these are real people and families.

love how strong the group think is in the sub. seriously your only rebuttal is “well the people in power!” as if that excuses you from showing decency?

imagine if after a tornado we said “wow new high score, that many people have never died before”

y’all think you’re morally untouchable because you care about covid but you’re doing it for the wrong reason it seems. rather it being because you’re a decent human, it’s just so you can prove your point.

yeah... fuck this sub i’m out. i can keep track of the daily cases myself. it’s slowly turned into an echo chamber and if you slightly go against the grain you get downvoted to oblivion. 

i seriously recommend most of y’all to start going to therapy. they do virtual sessions so look into those.

don’t lose sight of humanity.

fuck anyone who downvoted me.

Been a minute since we had a new high score for # of cases, or am I understanding this post wrong?

GET VACCINATED SO WE CAN BE RID OF THIS VIRUS. We don’t want a fucking variant or another resurge because immunity is wearing off.
