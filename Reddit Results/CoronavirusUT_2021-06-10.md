## Comment #1


I had body aches, chest pains, food tastes funny, my head hurt, I could not stay warm, I could barely drink water without getting super cold and IHC tested me right away! I woke up the next morning spent the day with my kids, in the other room, with my temp about 99.5. Today Friday, April 10, I have no fever and I hiked the heck out of my kids after I got the call I tested negative for Covid-19. WTF!
## Comment #2


I called the hotline and got a test an hour later. It was really easy. I'm having chest pain though so maybe that's why.
## Comment #3


Can't get tested basically unless you're short of breath

Any info available about breakthrough cases in vaccinated people? A coworkers roommates whose fully vaccinated just tested positive and is feeling pretty sick. I know that’s very rare but I’d love to see numbers.
## Comment #3


FUUUCK ME.  
This pandemic is never going to end. Why is it so hard to just be obedient... when I was a mormon it was drilled into my head to be 100% obedient. I've socially distanced, worn my mask, got the vaccine the moment I could. I'm doing everything I can to end this pandemic but it just feels like it will never end. At what point to we cross the threshold from pandemic to normal life? Like I really don't want to live in a world where the coronavirus is just a thing annually.
## Comment #4


Hmmmmm, right after the school mask mandate was lifted.
## Comment #5


Good thing literally no one is wearing masks anywhere anymore except for me and my family. The signs that say "masks required if you're unvaccinated but we're not going to check" isn't helping things, either.  

I seriously doubt 100% of the adults walking around in the stores I've been in recently are actually vaccinated, but 100% are going around maskless. We saw two different people who were coughing up a lung in Smith's earlier today.

This will continue to spread to those chicken shits that refuse to get vaccinated, and I'll keep wearing my mask (despite being fully vaccinated) because I don't want to be part of the problem.  

Good luck out there.

Not an encouraging trend...and now it feels like more than a fluke day or two
